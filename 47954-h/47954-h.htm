<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>"Immigration," said to me a distinguished
social worker and idealist, "is a wind that blows
democratic ideas throughout the world. In a
Siberian hut from which four sons had gone forth
to America to seek their fortune, I saw tacked up
a portrait of Lincoln cut from a New York newspaper.
Even there they knew what Lincoln stood
for and loved him. The return flow of letters and
people from this country is sending an electric
thrill through dwarfed, despairing sections of
humanity. The money and leaders that come
back to these down-trodden peoples inspire in
them a great impulse toward liberty and democracy
and progress. Time-hallowed Old-World
oppressions and exploitations that might have
lasted for generations will perish in our time,
thanks to the diffusion by immigrants of American
ideas of freedom and opportunity."</p>

<p>Rapt in these visions of benefit to belated humanity,
my friend refused to consider any possible
harm of immigration to this country. He
did not doubt it so much as ignore it. How should
the well-being of a nation be balanced against a
blessing to humanity?</p>

<p>"Think what American chances mean to these
poor people!" urged a large-hearted woman in
settlement work. "Thousands make shipwreck,
other thousands are disappointed, but tens of
thousands do realize something of the better,
larger life they had dreamed of. Who would exclude
any of them if he but knew what a land of
promise America is to the poor of other lands?"
Her sympathy with the visible alien at the gate
was so keen that she had no feeling for the invisible
children of <em>our</em> poor, who will find the
chances gone, nor for those at the gate of the
To-be, who might have been born, but will not be.</p>

<p>I am not of those who consider humanity
and forget the nation, who pity the living but not
the unborn. To me, those who are to come after
us stretch forth beseeching hands as well as the
masses on the other side of the globe. Nor do I
regard America as something to be spent quickly
and cheerfully for the benefit of pent-up millions
in the backward lands. What if we become
crowded without their ceasing to be so? I regard
it as a nation whose future may be of unspeakable
value to the rest of mankind, provided that the
easier conditions of life here be made permanent
by high standards of living, institutions and
ideals, which finally may be appropriated by all
men. We could have helped the Chinese a little
by letting their surplus millions swarm in upon
us a generation ago; but we have helped them infinitely
more by protecting our standards and
having something worth their copying when the
time came.</p>

<h2>THE OLD WORLD IN
THE NEW</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE ORIGINAL MAKE-UP OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE</h3>


<p>"God sifted a whole nation that He might
send choice grain into the wilderness."
So thought the seventeenth century of the migration
to Massachusetts Bay in the evil years of
Charles I; but what are <em>we</em> to think of it? There
is to-day so little sympathy with that remote, narrow
New England theocracy that it is well to
state again in living terms what part the coming
of the best of the English Puritans bore in building
up the American people.</p>

<p>As history makers, those who will suffer loss
and exile rather than give up an ideal that has
somehow taken hold of them are well nigh as unlike
ordinary folk as if they had dropped from
Mars. In every generation those who are capable
of heroic devotion to any ideal whatsoever
are only a remnant. Nine persons out of ten incline
to the line of least resistance or of greatest
profit, and will no more sacrifice themselves for
an ideal than lead will turn to a magnet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>That the ideal should be final is of small consequence.
It matters little whether it is a religious
tenet, a mode of worship, a method of life,
or a state of society. The essential thing is that
it stands apart from the appetites, passions, and
petty aims that govern most of us. Those who
will face panther and tomahawk for the sake of
their ideal are not to be swayed by the sordid
motives and fitful passions that lord it over commonplace
lives. Holding themselves to be instruments
for the fulfilment of some larger purpose,
men of this type make their mark upon the
world. The fathers dedicate themselves to establishing
godliness in the community. Their
posterity fly to arms in behalf of the principle
of "No taxation without representation." <em>Their</em>
posterity, in turn, war upon the liquor traffic,
slavery, or imperialism. As surely as one quarter
of us are still of the blood of the twenty thousand
Puritans who sought the wilderness between
1618 and 1640, so surely are there ideals not yet
risen above the horizon that will inspire Americans
in the generations to come.</p>

<p>The Dutch settled New Amsterdam from practical
motives, although some of them were Walloons
fleeing oppression in the Spanish Netherlands.
Gain prompted the peopling of Virginia,
and that colony received its share of human chaff.
The Council of Virginia early complained that

business with such an idle crue, as did thrust
themselves in the last voiage, that will rather
starve for hunger, than lay their hands to labor."</p>

<p>In 1637 the collector of the port of London
averred that "most of those that go thither ordinarily
have no habitation ... and are better
out than within the kingdom." After the execution
of Charles I, a number of Royalist families
removed to Virginia rather than brook the rule
of Cromwell. This influx of the well-to-do registers
itself in an abrupt increase in the size of
the land-grants and in a sudden rise in the number
of slaves. From this period one meets with
the names of Randolph, Madison, Monroe, Mason,
Marshall, Washington and many others that
have become household words. On the whole,
however, the exodus of noble "Cavaliers" to
Virginia is a myth; for it is now generally admitted
that the aristocracy of eighteenth-century
Virginia sprang chiefly from "members of the
country gentry, merchants and tradesmen and
their sons and relatives, and occasionally a minister,
a physician, a lawyer, or a captain in the
merchant service," fleeing political troubles at
home or tempted by the fortunes to be made in
tobacco.</p>

<p>Less promising was the broad substratum that
sustained the prosperity of the colony. For fifty
years indentured servants were coming in at a
rate from a thousand to sixteen hundred a year.
No doubt many an enterprising wight of the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
or Irish laboring-class sold himself for a term
into the tobacco-fields in order to come within
reach of beckoning Opportunity; but we know,
too, that the slums and alleys were raked for material
to stock the plantations. Hard-hearted
men sold dependent kinsfolk to serve in the colonies.
Kidnappers smuggled over boys and girls
gathered from the streets of London and Bristol.
About 1670, no fewer than ten thousand persons
were "spirited" from England in one year. The
Government was slow to strike at the infamous
traffic, for, as was urged in Parliament, "the
plantations cannot be maintained without a considerable
number of white servants."</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson deemed the Americans "a race
of convicts," who "ought to be content with anything
we allow them short of hanging." In the
first century of the colonies, gallows'-birds were
often given the option of servitude in the "plantations."
Some prayed to be hanged instead. In
1717 the British Government entered on the policy
of penal transportation, and thenceforth discharged
certain classes of felons upon the colonies
until the Revolution made it necessary to shunt
the muddy stream to Botany Bay. New England
happily escaped these "seven-year passengers,"
because she would pay little for them and because
she had no tobacco to serve as a profitable return
cargo. It is estimated that between 1750 and
1770 twenty thousand British convicts were exported
to Maryland alone, so that even the school-masters
there were mostly of this stripe. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
colonies bitterly resented such cargoes, but their
self-protective measures were regularly disallowed
by the selfish home government. American
scholars are coming to accept the British estimate
that about 50,000 convicts were marketed on this
side the water.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how quickly this "yellow
streak" in the population faded. No doubt the
worst felons were promptly hanged, so that those
transported were such as excited the compassion
of the court in an age that recognized nearly three
hundred capital offenses. Then, too, the bulk
were probably the unfortunate, or the victims of
bad surroundings, rather than born malefactors.
Under the regenerative stimulus of opportunity,
many persons reformed and became good citizens.
A like purification of sewage by free land was
later witnessed in Australia. The incorrigible,
when they did not slip back to their old haunts,
forsook the tide-water belt to lead half-savage
lives in the wilderness. Here they slew one another
or were strung up by "regulators," so that
they bred their kind less freely than the honest.
Thus bad strains tended to run out, and in the
making of our people the criminals had no share
at all corresponding to their original numbers.
Blended with the dregs from the rest of the population,
the convicts who were lazy and shiftless
rather than criminal became progenitors of the
"poor whites," "crackers," and "sandhillers"
that still cumber the poorer lands of the southern
Appalachians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>


<h4>THE FRENCH HUGUENOTS</h4>

<p>Probably no stock ever came here so gifted and
prepotent as the French Huguenots. Though
only a few thousand all told, their descendants
furnished 589 of the fourteen thousand and more
Americans deemed worthy of a place in "Appletons'
Cyclopedia of American Biography." In
1790 only one-half of one per cent. of our people
bore a French name; yet this element contributed
4.2 per cent. of the eminent names in our history,
or eight times their due quota. Like the Puritans
and the Quakers, the Huguenots were of an
element that meets the test of fire and makes supreme
sacrifices for conscience' sake. They had
the same affinity for ideals and the same tenacity
of character as the founders of New England,
but in their French blood they brought a sensibility,
a fervor, and an artistic endowment all
their own.</p>

<p>It was likewise a sturdy stock, and in the early
days of the settlement it was no unusual thing
for parties to walk from New Rochelle to church
in lower New York, a distance of twenty-three
miles. As a rule they walked this distance
with bare feet, carrying their shoes in their
hands.</p>


<h4>THE GERMANS</h4>

<p>When seeking settlers for his new colony, William
Penn gained much publicity for it in Germany,
where he had a wide acquaintance. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
German Pietists responded at once, and a stream
of picked families mingled with the English
Quakers who founded the City of Brotherly Love.
The first Germans to come were well-to-do people.
Nearly all had enough money left on arrival
to pay for the land they took up. In 1710,
however, there arose in parts of Germany a veritable
furor to reach the New World. The people
of the ravaged Palatinate became agitated over
the lure of America, and ship after ship breasted
the Delaware, black with Palatines, Hanoverians,
Saxons, Austrians, and Swiss. The cost of passage
from the upper Rhine was equal to $500 to-day;
but a vast number of penniless Germans got
over the barrier by contracting with the ship-owner
to sell themselves into servitude for a
term of years. These were known as "redemptioners,"
and their service was commonly for
from four to six years. Before the Revolution
not fewer than 60,000 Germans had debarked at
Philadelphia, to say nothing of the thousands that
settled in the South.</p>

<p>Although not without a sectarian background,
this great immigration bears clearly an economic
impress. The virtues of the Germans were the
economic virtues; invariably they are characterized
as "quiet, industrious, and thrifty." Although
Franklin wrote, "Those who come to us
are the most stupid of their own nation," he spoke
of them later, before a committee of the House of
Commons, as "a people who brought with them
the greatest of all wealth&mdash;industry and integrity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and characters that have been superpoised and
developed by years of persecution." It is likely
that the intellectual stagnation of the Pennsylvania
Germans and the smallness of their contribution
to American leadership has been due to pietistic
contempt for education rather than to the
natural qualities of the stock.</p>


<h4>THE SCOTCH-IRISH</h4>

<p>The flailing of the clans after the futile rising
of 1745 made the Scots restless, and in the last
twelve years of the colonial era 20,000 Highlanders
sought homes in America. But most of our
Scottish blood came by way of Ireland. Early
in the eighteenth century the discriminations of
Parliament against the woolen industry of Ireland,
and against Presbyterianism, provoked the
largest immigration that occurred before the Revolution.
The Ulster Presbyterians were descended
from Scotsmen and English who had been
induced between 1610 and 1618 to settle in the
north of Ireland, and who were, in Macaulay's
judgment, "as a class, superior to the average of
the people left behind them." They cared for
ideas, and at the beginning of the outflow there
was probably less illiteracy in Ulster than anywhere
else in the world. Entire congregations
came, each headed by its pastor. "The whole
North is in a ferment," lamented an Irish archbishop
in 1728. "It looks as if Ireland were to
send all her inhabitants hither," complained the
governor of Pennsylvania. About 200,000 came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
over, and on the eve of the Revolution the stock
was supposed to constitute a sixth of the population
of the colonies. They settled along the
frontier, and bore the brunt of the warfare with
the savage. It was owing chiefly to them that the
Quakers and Germans of Pennsylvania were left
undisturbed to live up to their ideals of peace
and non-resistance. In eminence, the lead of the
Scotch-Irish has been in government, exploration,
and war, although they have not been lacking in
contributors to education and invention. In art
and music they have had little to offer.</p>

<p>The outstanding trait of the Scotch-Irish was
<em>will</em>. No other element was so masterful and
contentious. In a petition directed against their
immigration, the Quakers characterized them as
a "pernicious and pugnacious people" who "absolutely
want to control the province themselves."
The stubbornness of their character is probably
responsible for the unexampled losses in the battles
of our Civil War. They fought the Indian,
fought the British with great unanimity in two
wars, and were in the front rank in the conquest
of the West. More than any other stock has this
tough, gritty breed, so lacking in poetry and sensibility,
molded our national character. If to-day
a losing college crew rows so hard that they
have to be lifted from their shell at the end of
the boat-race, it is because the never-say-die
Scotch-Irish fighters and pioneers have been the
picturesque and glowing figures in the imagination
of American youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Looked at broadly, the first peopling of this
country owes at least as much to the love of liberty
as to the economic motive. In the seventeenth
century the peoples of the Old World
seemed to be at odds with one another. Race
trampled on race, and the tender new shoots of
religious yearning were bruised by an iron state
and an iron church. The rumor of a virgin land
where the oppressed might dwell in peace drew
together a population varied, but rich in the
spirited and in idealists. What a contrast between
the English colonies and those of the orthodox
powers! For the intellectual stagnation
of the French in Canada, thank Louis XIV, who
would not allow Huguenots to settle in New
France. Spain barred out the foreigner from her
colonies, and even the Spaniard might not go
thither without a permit from the Crown. Heretics
were so carefully excluded that in nearly
three centuries the Inquisition in Mexico put to
death "only 41 unreconciled heretics, a number
surpassed in some single days [in Spain] in
Philip II's time." No wonder Spanish-American
history shows men swayed by greed, ambition,
pride, or fanaticism, but very rarely by a
moral ideal.</p>

<p>Let no one suppose, however, that, as were the
original settlers, so must their descendants be.
When you empty a barrel of fish fry into a new
stream there is a sudden sharpening of their
struggle for existence. So, when people submit
themselves to totally strange conditions of life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a><br /><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a><br /><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Death whets his scythe, and those who survive are
a new kind of "fittest."</p>

<h4>THE TOLL OF THE SEA</h4>

<p>Were the Atlantic dried up to-day, one could
trace the path between Europe and America by
cinders from our steamers; in the old days it
would have revealed itself by human bones. The
conditions of over-sea passage then brought about
a shocking elimination of the weaker. The ships
were small and crowded, the cabins close, and the
voyage required from six to ten weeks. "Betwixt
decks," writes a colonist, "there can hardlie
a man fetch his breath by reason there ariseth
such a funke in the night that it causeth putrifacation
of the blood and breedeth disease much
like the plague."</p>

<p>In a circular, William Penn urged those who
came to keep as much upon deck as may be, "and
to carry store of <i>Rue</i> and <i>Wormwood</i>, or often
sprinkle <i>Vinegar</i> about the Cabbin." The ship
on which he came over lost a third of its passengers
by smallpox. In 1639 the wife of the governor
of Virginia writes that the ship on which she
had come out had been "so pestered with people
and goods ... so full of infection that after a
while they saw little but throwing people overboard."
One vessel lost 130 out of 150 souls.
One sixth of the three thousand Germans sent
over in 1710 perished in a voyage that lasted from
January to June. No better fared a shipload of
Huguenot refugees in 1686. A ship that left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Rotterdam with 150 Palatines landed fewer than
fifty after a voyage of twenty-four weeks. In
1738 "malignant fever and flux" left only 105
out of 400 Palatines. In 1775 a brig reached New
York, having lost a hundred Highlanders in passage.
It was estimated that in the years 1750 and
1755 two thousand corpses were thrown overboard
from the ships plying out of Rotterdam. In
1756, Mittelberger thus describes the horrors of
the passage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>During the voyage there is aboard these ships terrible
misery, stench, fumes, vomiting, many kinds of sickness,
fever, dysentery, scurvy, mouth-rot, and the like,
all of which come from old and sharply salted food and
meat, also from very bad and foul water, so that many
die miserably.... Many hundred people necessarily
perish in such misery and must be cast into the sea.
The sighing and crying and lamenting on board the ship
continues night and day.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus many poor-conditioned or ill-endowed immigrants
succumbed en route. Those of greater
resolution stood the better chance; for there was
a striking difference in fate between those who
lay despairing in the cabins and those who
dragged themselves every day to the life-giving
air of the deck.</p>


<h4>THE SIFTING BY THE WILDERNESS</h4>

<p>Even after landing, the effects of the voyage
pursued the unfortunates. In 1604, De Monts
lost half his colony at St. Croix the first winter.
More than half the Pilgrims were dead before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the <i>Mayflower</i> left for home, four months after
reaching Plymouth. Of the Puritans who came
to Massachusetts Bay in 1629, a fifth were under
ground within a year. Of the 1500 who came over
in the summer of 1630, 200 died before December.
In 1754, a Philadelphia sexton testified that up
to November 14 he had buried that year 260 Palatines.</p>

<p>In the South lay in wait the Indian and the
malaria-bearing mosquito, and the latter slew
more. The whites might patch a truce with the
redskin, but never with the mosquito. They died
as die raw Europeans to-day along the lower
Niger or in the delta of the Amazon. In June,
1610, only 150 persons were living on the banks
of the James River out of 900 who had been landed
there within three years. By 1616, 1650 persons
altogether had been sent out; of these 300 had
returned, and about 350 were living in Virginia.
During a twelvemonth in 1619-20, 1200 left England,
but only 200 were alive in April, 1620. Fifty
years later, Governor Berkeley stated: "There
is not oft seasoned hands (as we term them) that
die now, whereas heretofore not one out of five
escaped the first year." A "seasoned" servant,
having only one more year to serve, brought a
better price than a new-comer, with seven and a
half years to serve. Surely the survivors of such
a shock had a tough fiber to pass on to their descendants.
It is such selection that explains in
part the extraordinary blooming of the colonies
after the cruel initial period was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>


<h4>THE IMPRESS OF THE FRONTIER</h4>

<p>No doubt the iron hardihood of the South African
Boers was built up by the succumbing of
physical and moral weaklings amid a wilderness
environment. In the same way our frontier made
it hard for the soft basswood type to survive.
Of the 380 persons whom Robertson collected in
North Carolina in 1779 to found what is now
Nashville, only 134 were alive at the end of a
year, although not one natural death had
occurred. Six months later only seventy were left
alive. If there had been any weaklings in the
party, by this time surely the tomahawk would
have found them. No wonder, then, that when the
vote was cast on the question of staying or going
back, no one voted for going back. The less
hardy, too, succumbed to the fever and ague, which
decimated the settlers of the wooded country
until they had cleared the forests and drained the
marshes.</p>

<p>In the early days there streamed over the Wilderness
Road that led to the settlements in Kentucky
two tides, an outgoing tide of stout-hearted
pioneers, seeking farms in the lovely blue-grass
land, and a return flow of timid or shiftless people,
affrighted by the horrors of Indian warfare
or tired of the grim struggle for subsistence amid
the stumps. The select character of those who
built up these exposed settlements explains the
wonderful forcefulness of the people of Kentucky
and Ohio, especially before they had given so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
many of their blood to found the commonwealths
farther west. Thanks to the protecting frontier
garrisons, the settlers of the trans-Mississippi
States were perhaps not so rigorously selected
as the trans-Alleghany pioneers; but, on the other
hand, they were themselves largely of pioneer
stock.</p>

<p>No doubt the "run of the continent" has improved
the fiber of the American people. Of
course the well established and the intellectuals
had no motive to seek the West; but in energy
and venturesomeness those who sought the frontier
were superior to the average of those in their
class who stayed behind. It was the pike rather
than the carp that found their way out of the pool.
Now, in the main, those who pushed through the
open door of opportunity left more children than
their fellows who did not. Often themselves
members of large families, they had fecundity, as
it were, in the blood. With land abundant and
the outlook encouraging, they married earlier.
In the narrow life of the young West, love and
family were stronger interests than in the older
society; hence all married. Thanks to cheap living
and to the need of helpers, the big family
was welcomed. Living by agriculture, the West
knew little of cities, manufactures, social rivalry,
luxury, and a serving class, all foes of rapid multiplication.</p>

<p>In 1802, Michaux found the families of the
Ohio settlers "always very numerous," and of
Kentucky he wrote: "There are few houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
which contain less than four or five children."
Traveling in the Ohio Valley in 1807, Cumings
observed: "Throughout this whole country,
whenever you see a cabin you see a swarm of
children"; and Woods wrote in 1819: "The first
thing that strikes a traveler on the Ohio is the immense
number of children." But there is solider
proof of frontier prolificacy. The census of 1830
showed the proportion of children under five years
in the States west of the Alleghanies to be a third
to a half greater than in the seaboard region.
The proportion of children to women between
fifteen and fifty was from fifty to a hundred per
cent. greater. In 1840, children were forty per
cent. more numerous among the Yankees of the
Western Reserve than among their kinsmen in
Connecticut. The next half-century took the
edge off the fecundity of the people of the Ohio
Valley; but their sons and daughters who had
pushed on into Kansas, Nebraska, and Minnesota,
showed families a fifth larger. In 1900, the
people of the agricultural frontier&mdash;Texas, Oklahoma,
and the Dakotas&mdash;had a proportion of children
larger by twenty-eight per cent. than that of
the population between Pittsburgh and Omaha.</p>

<p>If the frontier drew from the seaboard population
a certain element, and let it multiply more
freely than it would have multiplied at home, the
frontier must have made that element more plentiful
in the American people, taken as a whole;
and this, indeed, appears to be what actually occurred.
No one ventures to assert that the Americans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
are differentiated from the original immigrating
stocks by superiority in any form of
talent or in any kind of sensibility; but they impress
all foreign observers with their high endowment
of energy, tenacity of purpose, and willingness
to take risks, and these are just the qualities
that are fostered and made more abundant by
the wilderness. I do not maintain that life in
America has added any new trait to the descendants
of transplanted Europeans, nor has it filled
them all with the pioneer virtues. What I do
mean is that, owing to the progressive peopling
of the fertile wilderness, certain valuable strains
that once were represented in, say, a sixth of the
population, might come to be represented in a
quarter of it; and the timid, inert sort might
shrivel from a fifth of the population to a tenth.
Such a shifting in the numerical strength of types
would account both for the large contingent of
the forceful in the normal American community,
and for the prevalence of the ruthless, high-pressure,
get-there-at-any-cost spirit which leaves in
its wake achievement, prosperity, neurasthenia,
Bright's disease, heart failure, and shattered
moral standards.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE CELTIC IRISH</h3>


<p>From the outbreak of the Revolution until
the fourth decade of the nineteenth century
there was a lull in immigration. In a lifetime
fewer aliens came than now debark in a couple
of months. During these sixty years powerful
forces of assimilation were rapidly molding a
unified people out of the motley colonial population.
In the fermenting West, the meeting-place
of men from everywhere, elements of the greatest
diversity were blending into a common American
type which soon began to tinge the streams of
life that ran distinct from one another in the seaboard
States. Then came another epoch of vast
immigration, which has largely neutralized the
effect of the nationalizing forces, and has brought
us into a state of heterogeneity like to that of the
later colonial era.</p>


<h4>THE HIBERNIAN TIDE</h4>

<p>After the great lull, the Celtic Irish were the
first to come in great numbers. From 1820 to
1850 they were more than two-fifths of all immigrants,
and during the fifties more than one-third.
More than a seventh of our 30,000,000 immigrants
have brought in their aching hearts memories of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the fresh green of the moist island in the Northern
sea. The registered number is about 4,250,000,
but the actual number is larger, for many of
the earlier Irish, embarking in English ports,
were counted as coming from England. No doubt
the Irish who have suffered the wrench of expatriation
to America outnumber the present population
of the Green Isle, which is only a little
more than one-half of what it was before the crisis
of famine, rebellion, and misery that came about
the middle of the nineteenth century. It is, indeed,
a question whether there is not more Irish
blood now on this side of the Atlantic than on the
other. It is possible that during Victoria's reign
more of her subjects left Ireland in order to live
under the Stars and Stripes than left England in
order to build a Greater Britain under the Union
Jack.</p>

<p>In his "Coronation Ode," William Watson sees
Ireland as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... the lonely and the lovely Bride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom we have wedded, but have never won.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">The truth of this shows in the way the wandering
Irish still shun the lands under the British
crown. Most of the inviting frontier left on our
continent lies in western Canada. Already the
opportunities there have induced land-hungry
Americans to renounce their flag at the rate of a
hundred thousand in a single year. Yet the resentful
Irish turn to the narrower opportunities
of what they regard as their land of emancipation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
During a recent nine-year period, while
the English and the Scotch emigrants preferred
Canada to "the States," eleven times as many
Irish sought admission in our ports as were admitted
to Canada, although Canada's systematic
campaign for immigrants is carried on alike in
England, Scotland, and Ireland.</p>

<p>Very likely the Irish exodus is a closed chapter
of history. Ireland's population has been shrinking
for sixty years, and she has now fewer inhabitants
than the State of Ohio. People are leaving
the land of heather twice as fast as they are
abandoning the land of the shamrock. The early
marriage and blind prolificacy that had overpopulated
the land until half the people lived on potatoes,
and two-fifths dwelt in one-room mud cabins,
are gone forever, and Ireland has now one of the
lowest birth-rates in Europe. Gradually the people
are again coming to own the ground under
their feet; native industries and native arts are
reviving, and a wonderful rural coöperative movement
is in full swing. The long night of misgovernment,
ignorance, and superfecundity seems
over, the star of home rule is high, and the day
may soon come when these home-loving people
will not need to seek their bread under strange
skies.</p>

<p>During its earlier period, Irish immigration
brought in a desirable class, which assimilated
readily. Later, the enormous assisted immigration
that followed the famine of 1846-48 brought
in many of an inferior type, who huddled helplessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in the poorer quarters of our cities and became
men of the spade and the hod. After the
crisis was past, there again came a type that was
superior to those who remained behind. Of
course the acquiescent property-owning class
never emigrated, and those rising in trade or in
the professions rarely came unless they had fallen
into trouble through their patriotism. But of the
common people there is evidence that the more
capable part leaked away to America. The Earl
of Dunraven testifies:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Those who have remained have, for the most part,
been the least physically fit, the most mentally deficient,
and those who correspond to the lowest industrial standard....
For half a century and more the best
equipped, mentally and physically, of the population
have been leaving Ireland. The survival of the unfittest
has been the law, and the inevitable result, deterioration
of the race, statistics abundantly prove.</p></blockquote>

<p>Owing to this exodus of the young and energetic,
Ireland has become the country of old men
and old women. An eighth of her people are
more than sixty-five years old as against an
eleventh in England. In half a century the proportion
of lunatics and idiots in the population of
Ireland rose from one in 657 to one in 178. In
1906 the inspector of lunatics reported:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The emigration of the strong and healthy members of
the community not alone increases the ratio of the
insane who are left behind to the general population,
but also lowers the general standard of mental and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
bodily health by eliminating many of the members of
the community who are best fitted to survive and propagate
the race.</p></blockquote>

<p>He may not have known that, compared with
the rest of our immigrants, the Irish have twice
their share of insanity. The commissioners of
national education, after pointing with pride to
half a century's great reduction of illiteracy,
add:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The change for the better is remarkable when it is
remembered that it was the younger and better educated
who emigrated ... during this period, while the
majority of the illiterate were persons who were too
old to leave their homes.</p></blockquote>


<h4>THE IRISH IN THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE</h4>

<p>A close study of two hundred workingmen's
families in New York City showed the average
German family thirty dollars ahead at the end of
the year while the average Irish family of about
the same income had spent ten dollars more
than it had earned. Charity visitors know that
the Irish are often as open-handed and improvident
as the Bedouins. A Catholic educator accounts
for the scarcity of Irish millionaires by declaring
that his people are too generous to accumulate
great fortunes. They are free givers,
and no people are more ready to take into the
family the orphans of their relatives. In a
county of mixed nationalities there will be more
mortgages and stale debts against Irish farmers
than against any others. In a well-paid class of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
workers there will be more renters and fewer
home-owners among the Irish than among any
other nationality of equal pay. Less habitually
than others do the Irish make systematic provision
for old age. They depend on the earnings of
their children, who, indeed, are many and loyal
enough. But if the children die early or scatter,
the day-laborer must often eat the bread of
charity. A decade ago the Irish were found to
be relatively thrice as numerous in our almshouses
as other non-native elements. In the Northeast,
where they formed a quarter of the foreign-born
population, they furnished three-fifths of the
paupers. In Massachusetts, and in Boston as
well, they were four times as common in the almshouses
as out of them, although, to be sure, a part
of this bad showing is due to more of them being
aged. Nor do their children provide much better
for the future. In Boston, those of Irish parentage
produce two and one-half times their quota
of paupers. In both first and second generations
the frugal and fore-looking Germans there have
less than a tenth of the pauperism of the Irish,
while in 1910 in the country at large the tendency
of the Irish toward the almshouse was nearly
three times that of the Germans. Dr. Bushee,
who has investigated the conditions in Boston,
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It cannot be said that the ordinary Irishman is of
a provident disposition; he lives in the present and
worries comparatively little about the future. He is
not extravagant in any particular way, but is wasteful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
in every way; it is his nature to drift when he ought
to plan and economize. This disposition, combined
with an ever-present tendency to drink too much, is
liable to result in insecure employment and a small income.
And, to make matters worse, in families of this
kind children are born with reckless regularity.</p></blockquote>

<p>In extenuation, let it not be forgotten that at
home the earlier Irish immigrants had lived under
perhaps a more demoralizing social condition than
that from which any other of our immigrants have
come. Fleeing from plague and starvation, great
numbers were dumped at our ports with no means
of getting out upon the land. What was there for
them to do but to rush their labor into the nearest
market and huddle sociably together in wretched
slums, where, despite their sturdy physique, they
fell an easy prey to sickness and died off twice as
fast as they should? They lived as poorly as
do the Russian Jews when first they come; but,
being a green country-folk, they understood less
than do the town-bred Jews how to withstand the
noxious influences of cities and slums.</p>

<p>Certainly, along with their courage and loyalty,
the Irish did not bring the economic virtues.
Straight from the hoe they came, without even
the thrift of the farmer who owns the land he tills.
Many of them were no better fitted to succeed in
the modern competitive order than their ancestors
of the septs in the days of Strongbow. In value-sense
and foresight, how far they stand behind
Scot, Fleming, or Yankee! In the acquisitive
mêlée most of them are as children compared with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the Greek or the Semite. An observant settlement
worker has said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Irish are apt to make their occupation a secondary
matter. They remain idle if no man hires them;
but not so the Jew. If he can get no regular employment,
it is possible to gather rags and junk and sell
them.... If employed under a hard master, he still
works on under conditions that would drive the Irishman
to drink and the American to suicide until finally
he sees an opportunity to improve his condition.</p></blockquote>

<p>We must not forget that Irish development had
been forcibly arrested by the selfish policy of their
conquerors. In the latter part of the seventeenth
century the English Parliament, at the behest of
English graziers and farmers, put an end to Ireland's
cattle-trade to England, then to her exportation
of provisions to the colonies. Afterward
came export duties on Irish woolens, and,
later, complete prohibition of the exportation of
woolens to foreign countries. "Cotton, glass,
hats, iron manufactures, sugar refining&mdash;whatever
business Ireland turned her hand to, and
always with success&mdash;was in turn restricted."
The result was that the natural capacity of the
people was repressed, the growth of industrial
habits was checked, and the country was held down
to simple agriculture under a blighting system of
absentee landlordism. Still, we cannot overlook
the success of the Scottish Lowlanders in Ulster
under the same strangling discriminations, nor
forget that the 3500 German Protestant refugees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
who were settled in Munster in 1709 prospered as
did their brother refugees in Pennsylvania, and
became in time much wealthier than their Celtic
neighbors.</p>

<p>A thousand years ago an Irish scholar, teaching
at Liège, acknowledged his love for the cup
in his invocation to the Muses, and addressed a
poem to a friend who, being the possessor of a
great vineyard, understood "how to awaken genius
through the inspiration of the heavenly dew."</p>


<h4>ALCOHOLISM THE FREQUENT CAUSE OF POVERTY</h4>

<p>It is this same "heavenly dew"&mdash;whose Erse
name <i>usquebaugh</i>, we have pronounced "whisky"&mdash;that,
more than anything else, has held back the
Irish in America. The Irishman is no more a
craver of alcohol than other men, but his sociability
betrays him to that beverage which is the
seal of good fellowship. He does not sit down
alone with a bottle, as the Scandinavian will do,
nor get his friends round a table and quaff <em>lager</em>,
as the German does. No "Dutch treat" for him.
He drinks spirits in public, and, after a dram or
two, his convivial nature requires that every
stranger in the room shall seal friendship in a
glass with him. His temperament, too, makes liquor
a snare to him. Where another drinker becomes
mellow or silent or sodden, the Celt becomes
quarrelsome and foolish.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago an analysis of more than
seven thousand cases of destitution in our cities
showed that drink was twice as frequent a cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of poverty among the Irish cases as among the
Germans, and occurred half again as often among
them as among the native American cases.
Among many thousands of recent applications
for charity, "intemperance of the bread-winner"
crops out as a cause of destitution in one case
out of twelve among old-strain Americans; but it
taints one case out of seven among the Irish and
one case out of six among the Irish of the second
generation. In the charity hospitals of New York
alcoholism is responsible for more than a fifth
of all the cases. Drink is the root of the trouble
in a quarter of the native Americans treated, in a
third of the Irish patients, and in two-fifths of
the cases among the native-born of Irish fathers.
Contrast this painful showing with the fact that
one Italian patient out of sixty, one Magyar patient
out of seventy, one Polish patient out of
eighty, and one Hebrew patient out of one hundred
is in the hospital on account of drink!</p>


<h4>IRISH NEAR THE FOOT OF THE LIST IN CRIME</h4>

<p>In the quality of their crimes our immigrants
differ more from one another than they do in
complexion or in the color of their eyes. The
Irishman's love of fighting has made Donnybrook
Fair a byword; yet it is a fact that personal violence
is six or seven times as often the cause of
confinement for Italian, Magyar, or Finnish prisoners
in our penitentiaries as for the Irish.
Patrick may be quarrelsome, but he fights with
his hands, and in his cups he is not homicidal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
like the South Italian, or ferocious, like the
Finn. Three-fifths of the Hebrew convicts are
confined for gainful offenses, but only one-fifth
of the Irish. Among a score or more of nationalities,
the Irish stand nearly at the foot of the list
in the commission of larceny, burglary, forgery,
fraud, or homicide. Rape, pandering, and the
white-slave traffic are almost unknown among
them. What could be more striking than the fact
that more than half of the Irish convicts have
been sent up for "offenses against public order,"
such as intoxication and vagrancy! One cannot
help feeling that the Celtic offender is a feckless
fellow, enemy of himself more than of any one
else. It is usually not cupidity nor brutality nor
lust that lodges him in prison, but conviviality
and weak control of impulses.</p>

<p>It is certain that no immigrant is more loyal
to wife and child than the Irishman. Out of
nearly ten thousand charity cases in which a wife
was the head of the family, the greatest frequency
of widowhood and the least frequency of desertion
or separation is among the Irish. In only
eighteen per cent. of the Irish cases is the husband
missing; whereas among the Hebrews, Slovaks,
Lithuanians, and Magyars he is missing
in from forty to fifty per cent. of the cases. But
the sons of Irish, with that ready adaptation to
surroundings characteristic of the Celt, desert
their wives with just about the same frequency as
men of pure American stock; namely, thirty-six
per cent., or twice that of their fathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>


<h4>GREAT CHANGES IN OCCUPATION AMONG THE IRISH</h4>

<p>Thirty years ago, when the Irish and the Germans
in America were nearly equal in number,
there were striking contrasts in the place they took
in industry. As domestic servants, laborers, mill-hands,
miners, quarrymen, stone-cutters, laundry
workers, restaurant keepers, railway and
street-car employees, officials and employees
of government, the Irish were two or three
times as numerous as the Germans. On the
other hand, as farmers, saloon-keepers, bookkeepers,
designers, musicians, inventors, merchants,
manufacturers, and physicians, the Germans
far outnumbered the Irish. Where artistic
skill is required, as in confectionery, cabinet-making,
wood-carving, engraving, photography,
and jewelry-making; where scientific knowledge
is called for, as in brewing, distilling, sugar-refining,
and iron manufacture, the Irish were hopelessly
beaten by the trained and plodding Germans.</p>

<p>For a while, the bulk of Irish formed a pick-and-shovel
caste, claiming exclusive possession of
the poorest and least honorable occupations, and
mobbing the Chinaman or the negro who intruded
into their field. But the record of their children
proves that there is nothing in the stock that
dooms it forever to serve at the tail-end of a
wheelbarrow. Take, for instance, those workers
known to the statistician as "Female bread-winners."
Of the first generation of Irish, fifty-four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
per cent. are servants and waitresses; of the
second generation, only sixteen per cent. Whither
have these daughters gone? Out of the kitchen
into the factory, the store, the office, and the
school. In the needle trades they are twice as
frequent as Bridget or Nora who came over in the
steerage. Five times as often they serve behind
the counter, seven times as often they work at the
desk as stenographer or bookkeeper, five times
as frequently they teach. One native girl out of
twelve whose fathers were Irish is a teacher, as
against one girl out of nine with American fathers.
The Irish girls of the second generation are twice
as well represented as the native-born German
girls. Evidently it will not be long before they
have their full share of school positions. In
thirty leading cities eighteen per cent. of the
teachers are second-generation Irish; and there
are cities where these swift climbers constitute
from two-fifths to a half of the teaching force.</p>

<p>'Tonio or Ivan now wields the shovel while
Michael's boy escapes competition with him by
running nimbly up the ladder of occupations.
As compared with their immigrant fathers, the
proportion of laborers among the sons of Irishmen
is halved, while that of professional men and
salesmen is doubled, and that of clerks, copyists,
and bookkeepers is trebled. The quota of saloon-keepers
remains the same. There is no drift into
agriculture or into mercantile pursuits. In the
cities the Irish suffer little from the competition
of the later immigrants because, thanks to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a><br /><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a><br /><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
political control, they divide among themselves
much of the work carried on by the municipality
as well as the jobs under the great franchise-holding
corporations. So far, the strength of the
Irish has been in personal relations. They shine
in the forum, in executive work, in public guardianship,
and in public transportation, but not in
the more monotonous branches of manufacture.
In the colleges it has been noted that the students
of Irish blood are strong for theology and law,
but show little taste for medicine, engineering, or
technology.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="irish" id="irish"></a>
<img src="images/i037.jpg" width="600" height="382" alt="irish" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Distribution of Irish and natives of Irish Parentage&mdash;1910</p></div>
</div>

<p>Among the first thousand men of science in
America the Irish are only a fourth as well represented
as the Germans, a fifteenth as well as the
English and Canadians, and a twentieth as well
as the Scotch. This backwardness is in part due
to the overhang of bad conditions; and the compilers
of the table very properly suggest that "the
native-born sons of Irish-born parents may not be
inferior in scientific productivity to other classes
of the community." The same comment may be
made on the fact that of the persons listed in
"Who's Who in America," two per cent. were
German-born, another two per cent. were English-born,
but only one per cent. came from the land
of Erin.</p>


<h4>IRISH INTELLECT AND MENTAL ABILITY</h4>

<p>No doubt the peaks of Celtic superiority are
poetry and eloquence. Their gifts of emotion
and imagination give the Irish the key to human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
hearts. They are eloquent for the same reason
that they are poor technicians and investigators,
for the typical Celt sees things not as they really
are, <em>but as they are to him</em>.</p>

<p>The Irishman still leans on authority and shows
little tendency to think for himself. In philosophy
and science he is far behind the head of
the procession. Even when well-educated, he
thinks within the framework formed by certain
conventional ideas. Unlike the educated German
or Jew, he rarely ventures to dissect the ideas of
parental authority, the position of woman, property,
success, competition, individual liberty, etc.,
that lie at the base of commonplace thought.
Here, again, this limitation by sentiment and authority
derives doubtless from the social history
of the Irish rather than from their blood. They
have been engrossed with an old-fashioned problem&mdash;that
of freeing their country. Meanwhile,
the luckier peoples have swept on to ripen their
thinking about class relations, industrial organization,
and social institutions.</p>


<h4>TRAITS OF THE CELT</h4>

<p>With his Celtic imagination as a magic glass,
the Irishman sees into the human heart and learns
how to touch its strings. No one can wheedle
like an Irish beggar or "blarney" like an Irish
ward boss. Not only do the Irish furnish stirring
orators, persuasive stump-speakers, moving
pleaders, and delightful after-dinner speech-makers,
but they give us good salesmen and successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
traveling-men. Then, too, they know how
to manage people. The Irish contractor is a
great figure in construction work. The Irish
mine "boss" or section foreman has the knack
of handling men. The Irish politician is an adept
in "lining up" voters of other nationalities.
More Germans than Irish enlisted in the Union
armies, but more of the Irish rose to be officers.
In the great corporations Americans control policy
and finance, Germans are used in technical
work, and Irishmen are found in executive positions.
The Irish are well to the fore in organizing
labor and in leading athletics. "Of two applicants,"
says a city school superintendent, "I
take the teacher with an Irish name, because
she will have less trouble in discipline, and hits
it off better with the parents and the neighborhood."</p>

<p>Whatever is in the Irish mind is available on
the instant, so that the Irish rarely fail to do
themselves justice. They keep their best foot
forward, and if they fall, they light on their feet.
They succeed as lawyers not only because they can
play upon the jury, but because they are quick
in thrust and parry. They abound in newspaper
offices because their imagination enables them to
keep "in touch" with the public mind. The
Irishman rarely attains the thorough knowledge
of the German physician; but he makes his mark
as surgeon, because he is quick to perceive and to
decide when the knife discloses a grave, unsuspected
condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The Irishman accepts the Erse proverb, "Contention
is better than loneliness." "His nature
goes out to the other fellow all the time," declares
a wise priest. The lodge meeting of a Hibernian
benevolent association is a revelation of kindness
and delicacy of feeling in rough, toil-worn men.
A great criminal lawyer tells me that if he has a
desperate case to defend, he keeps the cold-blooded
Swede off the jury and gets an Irishman on, especially
one who has been "in trouble." Bridget
becomes attached to the family she serves, and,
after she is married, calls again and again "to
see how the childher are coming on." Freda,
after years of service, will leave you off-hand
and never evince the remotest interest in
your family. The Irish detest the merit system,
for they make politics a matter of friendship and
favor. In their willingness to serve a friend they
are apt to lose sight of the importance of preparation,
fitness and efficiency in the public servant.
Hence they warm to a reform movement only
when it becomes a fight on law-breakers. Then
the Hibernian district attorney goes after the
"higher-ups" like a St. George. When the Irish
do renounce machine politics, they become broad
democrats rather than "good government"
men.</p>

<p>Imaginative and sensitive to what others think
of him, the Celt is greatly affected by praise and
criticism. Unlike the Teuton, he cannot plod patiently
toward a distant goal without an appreciative
word or glance. He does his best when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
is paced, for emulation is his sharpest stimulus.
The grand stand has something to do with the
Irish bent for athletic contests. Irish school-children
love the lime-light, and distinguish themselves
better on the platform than in the classroom.
Irish teachers with good records in the
training-school are less likely than other teachers
to improve themselves by private study.</p>

<p>"The Irish are wilder than the rest in their
expression of grief," observes the visiting nurse,
"but they don't take on for long." The Irishman
is less persistent than others in keeping up
the premiums on his insurance policy, the payments
on his building-and-loan association stock.
He is quick to throw up his job or change his place
in order to avoid sameness. "My will is strong,"
I heard a bright-eyed Kathleen say, "but it keeps
changing its object; Gunda [her Norwegian
friend] is <em>so</em> determined and fixed in purpose!"
There is a proverb, "The Irishman is no good
till he is kicked," meaning that he is unstable till
his blood is up. Once his fighting spirit is roused,
he proves to be a "last ditcher." As a soldier,
he is better in a charge than in defense, and if
held back, he frets himself to exhaustion.</p>

<p>A professor compares his Celtic students to
the game trout, which makes one splendid dash
for the fly, but sulks if he misses it. A bishop
told me how his prize-man, an Irish youth, sent to
Paris to study Hebrew, was amazed at the prodigious
industry of his German and Polish chums.
"I never knew before," he wrote, "what study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
is." A settlement worker comments on the avidity
with which night-school pupils in Irish neighborhoods
select classes with interesting subjects
of instruction, and the rapidity with which they
drop off when the "dead grind" begins. Their
temperament rebels at close, continuous application.
The craftsman of Irish blood is likely to
be a little slapdash in method, and he rarely
stands near the top of his trade in skill. The
Irishman succeeds best in staple farming&mdash;all
wheat, all cotton, or all beets. With the advent
of diversified farming, he is supplanted by the
painstaking German, Scandinavian, or Pole.
Work requiring close attention to details&mdash;like
that of the nurseryman, the florist, or the breeder&mdash;falls
into the hands of a more patient type. In
banking and finance, men of a colder blood control.</p>


<h4>FUTURE OF THE IRISH-AMERICAN</h4>

<p>The word "brilliant" is oftener used for the
Irish than for any other aliens among us save the
Hebrews. Yet those of Irish blood are far from
manning their share of the responsible non-political
posts in American society. Their contribution
by no means matches that of an equal
number of the old American breed. But, in sooth,
it is too soon yet to expect the Irish strain to show
what it can do. Despite their schooling, the children
of the immigrant from Ireland often become
infected with the parental slackness, unthrift, and
irresponsibility. They in turn communicate some
of the heritage to their children; so that we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
have to wait until the fourth generation before
we shall learn how the Hibernian stock compares
in value with stocks that have had a happier social
history.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE GERMANS</h3>


<p>More than 5,250,000 people have been contributed
to our population by Germany in
the last ninety years. Deducting the Poles from
eastern Prussia, and counting Germans from
Russia, Austria, Bohemia, and eastern Switzerland,
we have, no doubt, received more than 7,000,000
whose mother-tongue was the speech of Luther
and Goethe. It is probable that German blood
has come to be at least a fourth part of the current
in the veins of the white people of this country,
so that this infusion alone equals the total
volume of Spanish and Portuguese blood in South
America.</p>

<p>From its rise in the thirties until after our
Civil War, the stream of immigrants from Germany
fluctuated with religious and political conditions
on the other side of the Atlantic rather
than with economic conditions on this side. Between
1839 and 1845 numerous Old Lutherans, resenting
the attempt of their king to unite the
Lutheran and the Reformed faiths, migrated
hither from Pomerania and Brandenburg. The
political reaction in the German states after the
revolution of 1830, and again after the revolution
of 1848, brought tens of thousands of liberty-lovers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
In 1851, in a book of advice to intending
immigrants, Pastor Bogen of Boston set forth as
the chief inducement to migrate the <em>freedom</em> the
Germans would enjoy in America&mdash;freedom from
oppression and despotism, from privileged orders
and monopolies, from intolerable imposts and
taxes, from constraint in matters of conscience,
from restrictions on settling anywhere in this
country of "exhaustless resources."</p>

<p>The political exiles famous as the "Forty-eighters"
included many men of unusual attainments
and character, who almost at once became
leaders of the German-Americans, exercising an
influence quite out of proportion to their numbers.
These university professors, physicians, journalists,
and even aristocrats, aroused many of their
fellow-countrymen to feel a pride in German culture,
and they left a stamp of political idealism,
social radicalism, and religious skepticism which
is slow to be effaced.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hausfrau</i> ideal for women and
to the militarist demand for recruits, the German
people has until recently persevered in a truly
medieval fecundity. Despite an outflow of
6,500,000 between 1820 and 1893, population has
doubled in seventy years and trebled in a hundred.
Prince Bülow complains that "the Poles
of eastern Prussia multiply like rabbits, while we
Germans multiply like hares." The fact is, a
generation ago the Germans, too, were multiplying
like rabbits. This is the reason why during
the seventies and eighties, although political conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
had much improved, great numbers of
farm-laborers, female servants, handicraftsmen,
small tradesmen, and other members of the humbler
classes, streamed out of crowded Germany
in the hope of improving their material condition.
The peasant living on black bread and potatoes
heard of and longed for the white bread and
fleshpots of the American West. Although the
overwhelming majority of the 1,500,000 Germans
who immigrated during the eighties represented
the lower economic strata, they came in with fair
schooling, considerable industrial skill, and, on
an average, three times as much money as the
Slav, Hebrew, or South European shows to-day
at Ellis Island.</p>

<p>The German influx dropped sharply as soon as
the panic of 1893 broke out, and when, after four
and a half years of economic submergence, this
country struggled to the surface, the tide of Teutons
was not ready to flow again. America's free
land was gone, and ruder peoples, with lower
standards of living, were crowding into her labor
markets. In the meantime, Germany's extraordinary
rise as a manufacturing country, her successes
in foreign trade, and her wonderful system
of protection and insurance for her labor population,
had made her sons and daughters loath to
migrate oversea. The immigration from Germany
into the United States is virtually a closed
chapter, and has been so for twenty years. Such
Germans as now arrive hail chiefly from Austria
and Russia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>


<h4>DISTRIBUTION THROUGHOUT THE STATES</h4>

<p>No other foreign element is so generally distributed
over the United States as the Germans.
A third of them are between Boston and Pittsburgh,
fifty-five per cent. live between Pittsburgh
and Denver, seven per cent. are in the South, and
five per cent. are in the far West.</p>

<p>In the South they are more numerous than any
other non-native element. They predominate, except
in New England, where the Irish abound; in
States along the northern border, into which filter
many Canadians; in the Dakotas, where the Scandinavians
lead; in the Mormon States, with their
many converts from England; and in Louisiana
and Florida, with their Italians and Cubans. In
Milwaukee nearly half the people are of German
parentage, in Cincinnati a quarter, in St. Louis
a fifth. A third of the Germans are in the rural
districts, whereas all but a sixth of the Irish are
in cities. Whether one considers their distribution
among the States, their partition between city
and country, or their dispersion among the callings,
the Germans will be found to be the most
pervasive element so far added to our people.</p>


<h4>ASSIMILATION WITH NEW NEIGHBORS</h4>

<p>Unlike the Irish immigrants, the Germans
brought a language, literature, and social customs
of their own; so that, although when scattered
they Americanized with great rapidity, wherever
they were strong enough to maintain churches and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
schools in their own tongue they were slow to take
the American stamp. For the sake of their beloved
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutschtum</i>, about the middle of the last
century the promoters of this migration dreamed
of creating in the West a German state where
Germans should hold sway and hand down their
culture in all its purity. Missouri, Illinois,
Texas, and later Wisconsin, seemed to hold out
such a hope. But the immigrants would not remain
massed, the Yankees pushed in, and "Little
Germany" never found a place on the map.</p>

<p>After 1870 the Teutonic overflow was prompted
by economic motives, and such a migration shows
little persistence in flying the flag of its national
culture. Numbers came, little instructed, or else
bringing a knowledge of Old Testament worthies
rather than of German poets, musicians, and artists.
In the words of a German-American,
Knortz: "Nine-tenths of all German immigrants
come from humble circumstances and have had
only an indifferent schooling. Whoever, therefore,
expects pride in their German descent from
these people, who owe everything to their new
country and nothing to their fatherland, simply
expects too much."</p>

<p>The "Forty-eighters" had given a great stimulus
to all German forms of life,&mdash;schools, press,
stage, festivals, choral societies, and gymnastic
societies,&mdash;but since the passing of these leaders
and the subsidence of the Teutonic freshet,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutschtum</i> has been on the wane. German
newspapers are disappearing, German-American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
books and journals become fewer, German book
stores are failing, German theaters are closing,
and the surviving German private schools may be
counted on the fingers. Probably not more than
ten per cent. of the children of German parentage
hear anything but English spoken at home.
Champions of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutschtum</i> admit sadly that nothing
but a strong current of immigration can preserve
it here. The spreading German-American
National Alliance is bringing about a marked revival,
but hardly will it succeed in persuading the
majority of its people to lay upon their children
the burden of a bi-lingual education. It is the apparent
destiny of the descendants of the myriads
of Germans who have settled here to lose themselves
in the American people, and to take the
stamp of a culture which is, in origin at least,
eighty per cent. British.</p>

<p>It is no small tribute to the solvent power
of American civilization that the stable and conservative
Germans, who, as settlers in Transylvania,
in Chili, or in Palestine, among the Russians
on the lower Volga, or among the Portuguese
in southern Brazil, are careful to keep themselves
unspotted from the people about them, have
proved, on the whole, easy to Americanize. Years
ago, Prof. James Bryce, just back from Ararat,
after noting the purity of the German culture preserved
by the Swabian colony in Tiflis, added:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It was very curious to contrast this complete persistence
of Teutonism here with the extremely rapid
absorption of the Germans among other citizens which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
one sees going on in those towns of the Western States
of America, where&mdash;as in Milwaukee, for instance&mdash;the
inhabitants are mostly Germans, and still speak English
with a markedly foreign accent.... Here they
are exiles from a higher civilization planted in the
midst of a lower one; there they lose themselves among
a kindred people, with whose ideas and political institutions
they quickly come to sympathize.</p></blockquote>


<h4>INFLUENCE OF THE GERMANS IN AMERICA</h4>

<p>The leanness of his home acres taught the German
to make the most of his farm in the New
World. The immigrant looked for good land
rather than for land easy to subdue. Knowing
that a heavy forest growth proclaims rich soil, he
shunned the open areas, and chopped his homestead
out of the densest woods. While the American
farmer, in his haste to live well, mined the
fertility out of the soil, the German conserved it
by rotating crops and feeding live stock. In caring
for his domestic animals, he set an example.
Just as the county agricultural fair, and the state
fair as well, is the development of the Pennsylvania-German
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jahrmarkt</i>, and the "prairie
schooner" is the lineal descendant of the "Conestoga
wagon," so the capacious red barns of the
Middle West trace their ancestry back to the big
barn which the Pennsylvania "Dutchman" provided
at a time when most farmers let their stock
run unsheltered.</p>

<p>Thanks partly to good farming and frugal living,
and partly to the un-American practice of
working their women in the fields, the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
farmers made money, bought choice acres from
under their neighbors' feet, and so kept other nationalities
on the move. This is the reason why
a German settlement spreads on fat soil and why
in time the best land in the region is likely to
come into German hands. Unlike the restless
American, with his ears ever pricked to the hail
of distant opportunity, the phlegmatic German
identifies himself with his farm, and feels a pride
in keeping it in the family generation after generation.
Taking fewer chances in the lottery of
life than his enterprising Scotch-Irish or limber-minded
Yankee neighbor, he has drawn from it
fewer big prizes, but also fewer blanks.</p>

<p>In quest of vinous exhilaration, our grandfathers
stood at a bar pouring down ardent
spirits. It is owing to our German element that
the mild <em>lager</em> beer has largely displaced whisky
as the popular beverage, while sedentary drinking
steadily gains on perpendicular drinking.
Because the toping of beer has from time immemorial
been interwoven with their social enjoyments,
and because beer, unlike whisky, makes
wassailers fraternal rather than wild and quarrelsome,
the Germans, supported by the Bohemians,
have offered, in the name of "personal
liberty," the most determined opposition to liquor
legislation. They may renounce the bowl,
but taken away it shall not be! In their loyalty
to beer, these Teutons out-German their cousins
in the Fatherland, who are of late turning from
the national beverage at an astonishing rate. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the World's Fair in St. Louis a number of American
scholars who had studied of yore in German
universities gave a luncheon to the visiting German
economists. Out of respect for their guests,
the hosts all filled the mugs of their student days;
but, to their astonishment, the Germans called
unanimously for iced tea!</p>

<p>The influence of the Germans in spreading
among us the love of good music and good drama
is acknowledged by all. But there is a more subtle
transformation that they have wrought on
American taste. The social diversions of the
Teutons, and their affirmance of the "joy of living,"
have helped to clear from our eyes the Puritan
jaundice that made all physical and social enjoyment
look sinful. If "innocent recreation"
and "harmless amusement" are now phrases to
conjure with, it is largely owing to the Germans
and Bohemians, with their love of song and mirth
and "having a good time." Few of the present
generation realize that fifty years ago the principal
place of amusement in the American town,
although as innocent of opera as a Kaffir <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">kraal</i>,
called itself the "opera-house," in order to avoid
the damning stigma the reigning Puritanism had
attached to the word "theater."</p>

<p>As voters, the Germans have shown little clannishness.
Their partizanship has not been
bigoted, and by their insistence on independent
voting they have perplexed and disgusted the
politicians. Before 1850, they saw in the Democratic
party the champion of the liberties for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a><br /><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a><br /><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
sake of which they had expatriated themselves.
But when the slavery issue came to be overshadowing,
the "Forty-eighters" were able to
swing them to the newly formed Republican
party, to which, on the whole, they have remained
faithful, although in some States their loyalty
has been much shaken by prohibition. On money
questions the Germans have been conservative.
Bringing with them the notion of an efficient civil
service, they have despised office-mongering and
have befriended the merit system. No immigrants
have been more apt to look at public
questions from a common-welfare point of view
and to vote for their principles rather than
for their friends. If by "political aptitude" is
meant the skill to use politics for private advantage,
then in this capacity the German must be
ranked low among our foreign-born.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Distribution of Germans and natives of German Parentage&mdash;1910</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the way of civil and political liberty, the
Germans added nothing to the old-English heritage
they found here; but in freedom of thought
their contribution has been invaluable. Where
there is no church, state, or upper class to hold it
in check, the community is likely to show itself imperious
toward the nonconformist. The New
England Puritan, who was oak to any civil authority
that he had not helped to constitute, was a reed
before the pressure of community opinion. The
sturdy Germans flouted this tyranny <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans</i> tyrant.
At a time when the would-be-respectable American
stifled under a pall of conventionality in regard
to religion and manners, they asserted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
right to think and speak for themselves without
incurring loss or ostracism. Then, too, the
scholarly German immigrant imparted to us his
sense of the dignity of science and its right to
be free, although, to be sure, this spirit has been
fostered among us chiefly by Americans who have
studied in German universities. On the whole,
in the way of intellectual liberty, the university-bred
Liberals of 1848 had as much to offer as they
gained in the way of political liberty.</p>


<h4>THE GERMANS IN THE CIVIL WAR</h4>

<p>At the outbreak of the Civil War the Germans,
with their deep detestation of slavery, played no
small rôle. In the South, those of later immigration
opposed the Confederacy; in the North their
leaders lined them up solidly in support of the
Union. About 200,000 Germans enlisted in the
Union army, more than there were of Irish volunteers,
although the Irish were more numerous
in the population of the loyal States. The militia
companies formed among the Germans in Missouri,
especially in St. Louis, were pivotal in saving
that State for the Union. The military
knowledge of Prussians who had seen service in
the old country was valued, sometimes over-valued,
in the earlier stage of the conflict. The
all-German divisions of Steinwehr and Schurz,
after being roundly, perhaps unjustly, abused for
not holding Jackson at Chancellorsville, fought
well at Gettysburg and distinguished themselves
in the "battle among the clouds."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>


<h4>THE GERMANS IN THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE</h4>

<p>Probably no compliment has ever been bestowed
on the Germans in America that did not
contain the words "industrious and thrifty."
Nor is it surprising that the members of a race so
forelooking and reflective rarely sink into the
mire of poverty. In 1900, the Germans were 25.8
per cent. of our foreign-born, and three years
later it was found that only 23.3 per cent. of the
foreign-born in our almshouses were Germans.
For the country at large, we have no means of
comparing the German with the American in his
ability to take care of himself; but studies made
in Boston showed that the proportion of Boston
Germans in the city almshouse was half that
of the English in that city, one-sixth of that of
the Scotch, and only one-tenth of that of the Irish.
In the state charitable institutions of Massachusetts,
Germans make a better showing than Celts,
but not so good a showing as Scandinavians and
Americans.</p>

<p>To the various relief agencies in Boston, Germans
apply less often than any other of the English-speaking
immigrants. The analyst of Boston's
foreign-born is struck by the small number
of Germans and Scandinavians who seek aid, and
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Occasionally, it is true, idle and shiftless families are
found among both these peoples; but on the whole they
are industrious and thrifty, and less hopeless poverty
is found among them than among almost any of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
other foreign immigrants.... The Germans are without
doubt the best type of immigrants which has settled
in Boston.</p></blockquote>

<p>In our cities, no other element has so large a
proportion of home-owners, and in the care of the
home they surpass all other nationalities save
the Swedes.</p>


<h4>ALCOHOLISM AMONG THE GERMANS</h4>

<p>The saturation of the social life of our Germans
with the amber beverage, as well as their
hostility to prohibition, prepares us to find alcoholism
very common among the disciples of St.
Gambrinus. The fact is, however, that in point
of sobriety hardly any North European makes so
good a record as the German. A few years ago
an analysis of 2075 charity cases showed that
drink as the cause of poverty occurred only one-half
as often among the German cases as among
the Irish, and two-thirds as often as among native
American cases. In the charity hospitals of
New York, the proportion of German patients
treated for alcoholism is only half as large as that
of the English and the native Americans, and only
a third as great as that of the Irish. The charity
workers in our cities report that "intemperance
of the bread-winner" is less often found to be the
cause of destitution among the German applicants
than among those of any other North-European
nationality. Among alien prisoners
only one German of twenty-two was committed
for intoxication as against one out of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Irish, one out of four French Canadians, one out
of five Scotch, and one out of eight Scandinavians.
On the other hand, the victims of drink are
far more numerous among them than among the
Italians, Magyars, Jews, and Syrians. These
peoples, vine-growers and wine-bibbers from
time immemorial, have had the chance to get
drunk many thousand years longer than the Celts
and Teutons; hence they have been more completely
purged of their alcoholics. While a light
beverage like beer produces fewer sots and
wrecks than the "water of life" so grateful to
the Northern palate, it produces a vast unreported
stupefying and deterioration; so there is
good reason why the German drinking customs
are being sloughed off in the Fatherland at the
very moment they are being warmly defended in
America.</p>


<h4>AMOUNT OF CRIME NORMAL AMONG GERMANS</h4>

<p>The striking thing about the abnormality of
the Germans is its normality in amount. Among
the foreign-born, the Germans have just about
their due share of insanity, neither less nor more.
Likewise, the marked feature of German crime
in this country is simply its featurelessness.
Among the twelve thousand-odd aliens in our
prisons, the German prisoners run a little above
the average in their bent for gainful offenses and
a little below the average in their crimes of violence.
In their leaning to other offenses they
come close to the mean. Among the twenty nationalities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
that figure in the police arrests of
Chicago, the German stands, with respect to almost
every form of misconduct, near the middle
of the list. The French and the Hebrews stand
out in bad eminence as offenders against chastity,
the Italians lead in murder and blackmail, the
Americans in burglary, the Greeks in kidnapping,
the Lithuanians in assault, the Irish in disorderly
conduct. But the German lacks distinction in
evil, never coming near either the top or the bottom
of the scale in predilection for any form of
crime. On the whole, his criminal bent is very
close to that of the native American.</p>


<h4>WIDE VARIETY OF OCCUPATION</h4>

<p>The Germans brought us much more in the way
of industrial skill and professional training than
the Irish; besides, they were much more successful
in planting themselves upon the soil. They
tended far more to farming and manufacturing,
far less to domestic and personal service and
transportation. The second generation shows no
marked drift away from the farm. In 1900,
three-fifths of all brewers in the country were
Germans, a third of the bakers and cabinet-makers,
a fifth of the saloon-keepers and butchers, a
sixth of the hatters, tailors, and coopers, and a
seventh of the musicians and teachers of music.
Yet only one male bread-winner out of nineteen
was a German.</p>

<p>The sons of Germans are a sixteenth of our
male labor force; but they furnish a quarter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the trunk-and-satchel makers, a fifth of the
bottlers, stovemakers, and engravers, and a
sixth of the upholsterers, bookbinders, paper-box
makers, butchers, brewers, and brass-workers.
In our cities the German baker, tailor,
butcher, cabinet-maker, or engraver is quite as
characteristic and familiar a figure as the Irish
drayman, fireman, brakeman, section boss, street-car
conductor, plumber, or policeman.</p>

<p>The immigrant German women begin rather
higher in the scale of occupation than the Irish,
but their daughters do not rise in life with such
amazing buoyancy as do the daughters of the
Irish. Between the first-generation and the second-generation
Germans the proportion of servants
and waitresses falls from a third of all female
bread-winners to a quarter. For the Irish the
drop is from fifty-four per cent. to sixteen per
cent. The second-generation Germans do not
show such an advance on their parents as do the
second-generation Irish, who bob up like corks released
at the bottom of a stream.</p>


<h4>TEUTONIC TRAITS</h4>

<p>Physically the German is strong, but often too
stocky for grace. A blend with the taller and
thinner American is likely to give good results in
figure. Being slow in response, he makes a poor
showing in competitive sports. His forte is
gymnastics rather than athletics, and he is to be
found in the indoor, sedentary trades rather than
in the active, outdoor callings. Not often will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
you come upon him riveting trusses far up on the
skyscraper or the railway bridge. His pleasures
he takes sitting rather than moving, so that he
haunts summer-garden and picnic-ground rather
than base-ball diamond and bowling-alley. For
all his traditional domesticity, he is a sociable
soul, and will lug off his entire family to a public
resort, when an American would prefer a pipe by
the fireside. He is fond of the table, and loves
to enjoy talk, music, or drama while eating and
drinking. In comparison with the native Americans,
or the Celts from the British Isles, the
Germans in America have the name of being materialistic.
If this be true, it is doubtless due to
the small representation among them of that noble
leavening type that has made the spiritual greatness
of Germany. Any one who has lived in the
old country knows that there is a kind of German
that one rarely sees among our fellow-citizens. Of
such were the "Forty-eighters"; but as their influence
fades, the idealism they fanned dies down,
and visitors from the Fatherland complain that
America has stamped its dollar-mark all over the
souls of their kinsmen here. Professor Hugo
Münsterberg, an impartial observer, judges that
"the average German-American stands below the
level of the average German at home."</p>

<p>But if he chases the dollar, let us grant that he
does it in his own way. Honest and stable, he
puts little faith in short-cuts to riches, such as
"scream" advertising, commercial humbug,
"faked" news, thimblerig finance, or political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
graft. He does not count on skipping many
rungs in the ladder of success. German business
enterprises grow slowly, but if you probe them,
you find a solid texture. The German is hard-headed,
and is not easily borne off his feet by the
contagion of example. To speculative fever and
to made panic he is rather immune. Because he
is less mobile than the American and does not
shift from one thing to another, he is more apt to
gain skill and turn out good work. Then, too, he
is not so keen to get on that he does not find the
artist's enjoyment and pride in the practice of
his craft. In a word, the Germans act in American
society as a neutral substance moderating
the action of an overlively ferment. For the
universal eagerness to be "wide awake" and
"up to date" has deposed habit, tradition, and
external authority as lords of life among us.</p>

<p>The German is lasting in his sympathies and
his antipathies and leisurely in his mental processes.
It takes him long to make up his mind
and longer to get an idea out of his head. In his
thinking he tries to grasp more things at a time
than does the Celt. Not for him the simple logic
that proceeds from one or two outstanding factors
in a situation and ignores all the rest. He
wants to be comprehensive and final where the
Latin aims to be merely clear and precise. It is
this very complexity of thought that makes the
German often silent, his speech heavy or confused.
But just this relish for details and this
passion for thoroughness make him a born investigator.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
This is why, on the practical side, the
German-American has most distinguished himself
in work that calls for long and close observation,
such as gardening, viticulture, breeding, forestry,
brewing, and the chemical industries.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago there was an outcry that the
Germans were introducing into this country the
virus of anarchism and socialism. It is now clear
that German socialism, instead of being a shattering
type of thought, is in fact highly constructive.
However bold and iconoclastic he may be in his
thinking, the German, with his respect for authority,
his slow reaction to wrong, and his love of
order and system, is a conservative by nature.
The children of revolutionary immigrants are
milder than their fathers were; and the German-Americans
are now very far from leading the van
of radicalism.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE SCANDINAVIANS</h3>


<p>Although Leif Ericson discovered America
in the year 1000 <small>A.D.</small>, his countrymen
made no serious use of his find until the latter
part of the nineteenth century. It is only sixty-four
years since the memorable visit of "the
Swedish Nightingale," Jenny Lind, opened our
eyes to the existence of the Northern peoples. In
fact, the few thousands that about this time began
to filter in were first known as "Jenny Lind
men." Now there are among us a million and a
quarter born in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark,
and, counting those of Scandinavian parentage
and grandparentage, it is safe to say that a quarter
of all this blood in the world is west of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>In 1874 the Icelanders celebrated the millennial
anniversary of the settlement of Iceland, and only
year before last certain of our fellow-citizens were
commemorating the millennial anniversary of the
cession of Normandy to Rollo the Dane. In all
the thousand years since these colonizations,
there has been no diffusion of Gothic blood to
compare with the settlement in this country of
nearly two million Scandinavian immigrants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Sweden has sent the most, but Norway has contributed
a larger proportion of her people than
any other country save Ireland. There are certainly
half as many of Norse blood here as there
are in the fatherland, and they own six times as
much farming land. A Norwegian economist estimates
that the property owned by his compatriots
in this country corresponds in value to the
entire national economy of Norway.</p>

<p>The crest of the Scandinavian wave passed
thirty years ago. The current runs still, but it
is a flow of job-seekers rather than of home-seekers.
America is no longer so attractive to the
land-hungry; besides, their home conditions have
greatly improved. By their wonderful development
of rural coöperation, the Danes have made
themselves the most envied of European peasant
farmers. By harnessing their waterfalls, the
Norwegians have gained a basis for new industries.
The Swedes have drawn the power of half
a million horses from their streams, and their
multiplying factories take on about ten thousand
new hands every year.</p>


<h4>DISTRIBUTION OF SCANDINAVIAN BLOOD</h4>

<p>The old Northwest, stretching from Detroit to
Omaha, and thence north to the boundary, has
been the Scandinavian's "land of Goshen."
Here is the "New Sweden" that Gustavus Adolphus
dreamed of when he planned a Swedish colony
on the Delaware. In 1850, when there were
only thirteen thousand of her race in that region,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Frederika Bremer then in St. Paul had the vision
of a Cumæan sibyl:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What a glorious new Scandinavia might not Minnesota
become! Here would the Swede find again his
clear, romantic lakes, the plains of Scania rich in corn,
and the valleys of Norrland; here would the Norwegian
find his rapid rivers, his lofty mountains, for I would
include the Rocky Mountains and Oregon in the new
kingdom; and both nations their hunting-fields and their
fisheries. The Danes might here pasture their flocks
and herds and lay out their farms on less misty coasts
than those of Denmark.... The climate, the situation,
the character of the scenery agree with our people
better than that of any other of the American
States.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is a striking fulfilment of her prophecy that
to-day a fifth of the Scandinavian blood in the
world is in this very region. Fifty years ago
Wisconsin led, with her great Norwegian contingent;
then Minnesota passed her, and later Illinois,
with Chicago as the lodestone. To-day two-fifths
of the people of Minnesota are of Scandinavian
strain. Northern Iowa has a strong infusion
of the blood, while the Dakotas are deeply
tinged. In 1870 four-fifths of all our Scandinavians
were in this region. The proportion fell
slowly to three-fourths in 1880, five-sevenths in
1890, two-thirds in 1900, and three-fifths in 1910.
Of late many have dropped into the ranks of
clanging industrialism between Pawtucket and
Pittsburgh, while the current of home-seekers
into the new Northwest has given Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and Oregon as many Scandinavians as there are
in the Dakotas.</p>


<h4>SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS</h4>

<p>Like the immigrants from Great Britain, the
Scandinavians came with a male preponderance
of about three-fifths. About a quarter of them
were servants at home, a third were common laborers,
and a sixth were skilled laborers. They
have brought far less skill than the British, and
distinctly less than the Germans and the Bohemians.</p>

<p>In point of <em>literacy</em> they lead the world. One
finds an illiterate among every twenty German
immigrants of more than fourteen years of age.
Of immigrants from other nations, one may find
an illiterate among every twenty-three Dutch,
thirty-eight Irish, fifty-two Welsh, fifty-nine Bohemians,
seventy-seven Finns, one hundred English,
and one hundred and forty-three Scotch;
but the proportion among those who come
from Scandinavia is <em>one in two hundred and fifty</em>.
What a contrast between these and the Lithuanians
and South Italians, half of whom are unable
to read any language!</p>

<p>It is perhaps the strain of melancholy lurking
in Northern blood that gives our Scandinavians
a tendency toward insanity slightly in excess of
the foreign-born as a whole, and decidedly
greater than that of Americans. In susceptibility
to tuberculosis they make a worse showing
than any others among our foreign-born save the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Irish. They die of it oftener than do their children
born in this country, but even these suffer
twice the losses of their American neighbors.
But the scourge is still worse in the old country;
so very likely we have here not a race weakness,
but a penalty for unhygienic conditions. In the
bitter North, with the forests disappearing, people
came to dread fresh air, and the trouble began
as soon as the open hearth gave way to the
tight stove.</p>

<p>In our Northwest many Scandinavians board
up or nail down their windows for the winter, and
in such homes one appreciates the <i>mot</i> evoked by
the query, "Why is the country air so pure?"
The answer is, "Because the farmers keep all the
bad air shut up in their houses." The second
generation are taking to ventilation, and in their
children very likely the Hyperboreans' horror of
fresh air will have wholly disappeared, and with
it their special susceptibility to the white plague.</p>

<p>The study of several thousand mixed marriages
in Minneapolis has led Professor Albert
Jenks of the University of Minnesota to this conclusion:
"The Irish blood tends to increase fecundity,
and the Scandinavian blood tends to
decrease fecundity, of other peoples in amalgamation."
Is this contrast due to the Scandinavians
being so fore-looking, whereas the Irish
give little heed to the future; to the fact that the
Scandinavians are the purest Protestants, while
the Irish are the purest Roman Catholics; or
to the coming together in the Scandinavians of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
prudence and Protestantism with a high status
of women? At any rate, such caution in family
is startling when one recalls that old Scandinavia
was the mother hive of the swarms of barbarians
that kept South Europeans in dread a thousand
years, or notes what William Penn found
among the Swedes on the Delaware two hundred
and thirty years ago: "They have fine children
and almost every house full; rare to find one of
them without three or four boys and as many
girls; some six, seven, or eight sons."</p>

<p>The primitive man commits crime from passion;
the developed man commits more of his
crimes from cupidity. Proverbially honest, the
Scandinavian is less prone than the American to
seek his living by crookedness. The gamut of
exploit that reaches from the <i>Artful Dodger</i> to
<i>Colonel Sellers</i> is alien to him. Nor is he subject
to the wild impulses that often crop out in the
Italian or the Slav. Much of his crime springs
from disorderly conduct, and drink must bear
most of the blame, for on the Scandinavian nature
liquor has a disastrous effect.</p>


<h4>ALCOHOLISM AMONG THE SCANDINAVIANS</h4>

<p>Pytheas of Marseilles, the explorer who about
the time of Alexander the Great gave the world
its first news of Norway, said that the people of
Thule made from honey "a very pleasant drink."
This beverage could hardly have touched the
right spot, for when the product of the still
reached the Thulites they fell upon it with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
joyous abandon of the inexperienced. A century
ago Scandinavia was the home of hard drinkers.
Even yet, in our cities, the "toughest" saloons
are kept by old-time Norsemen, who left
the fatherland before it began to dry out. One
hears a proverb which runs, "What won't the
German do for money and the Swede for whisky!"
As charity seekers and hospital patients, our
Scandinavians are not so alcoholic as the
British, but more so than the Teutons. More
and more, however, they come to us temperate,
and strong believers in sumptuary legislation;
for within a generation Scandinavia has become
the Sahara whence issue the desiccating simooms&mdash;Gothenburg
system, <i>samlag</i> system, etc.,&mdash;which
have taken much "wet" territory off the
map.</p>


<h4>FAVORITE OCCUPATIONS</h4>

<p>Rugged Norway freezes into the souls of her
sons a sense of the preciousness of level, fertile
land, and there are no great cities to infect the
imagination of her country dwellers. What wonder,
then, that in 1900 nearly four-fifths of our
Norwegians were outside the cities, most of them
sticking to the soil like limpets to a rock! In
1900 half of them were tillers, and sixty-three per
cent. of their grown sons. For the rest, they are
to be found in the forecastles of the great lakes,
in the copper and iron mines of upper Michigan,
in the coal-mines of Iowa, in Northern lumber-camps,
where they wield another pattern of ax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
than did their forbears, who, eight centuries ago,
were known as "ax-bearers" in the Eastern emperor's
body-guard. They work in the building
trades, on the railroads, in the flour-mills of the
wheat centers, and in the furniture-mills, the
plow-wagon-and-implement factories of the hardwood
belt. From his vast new circle of opportunities,
the Norwegian immigrant chooses those
that enable him to continue his life at home. He
insists on getting his living in connection with
soil, water, and wood. In the East he shuns mill
drudgery, but shines as a builder. A fourth part
of the Norwegian wage-earners in New York are
carpenters, while none are on the farms. In
Iowa two-thirds are on the farms, and only seven
per cent. are in the building trades.</p>

<p>Through the occupational choices of our Danes,
one can catch a glimpse of the lush meadows of
Jutland. Forty per cent. of them are on the
farm, ten per cent. are laborers, and four per
cent. are carpenters. In butter-making and
dairying they are six times as numerous as in the
general work of the country; in cabinet-making
and before the mast they are three and one-half
times as strong. As stock-raisers and drovers,
the second generation are five and one-half times
as strong as they are in other lines.</p>

<p>Coming from an industrial country, the Swedes
bring skill, and show no marked bent for agriculture.
Only thirty per cent. of them are at the
plow-tail; of their sons, forty-three per cent. The
rest will be carpenters, miners, and quarrymen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
railroad employees, machinists, iron- and steel-workers,
tailors, and teamsters. Although they
form only an eightieth of the army of bread-winners,
one out of twelve iron-workers, one out of
fourteen cabinet-makers, one out of twenty-one
boatmen and sailors, and one out of twenty-five
tailors is a Swede. The Swedish aristocratic
view of callings is perhaps responsible
for the fact that the immigrants' sons are three
times as successful in getting "white-handed"
jobs as the immigrants, and are much keener for
such work than the sons of our Norwegians.</p>

<p>A like difference is visible in the choices of the
daughters. Between the first generation and the
second the proportion in the "ladylike" jobs increases
from 3 per cent. to 13.5 per cent.
among the Swedes; from 4.2 per cent. to 9.8 per
cent. among the Norwegians. While the proportion
of servants and waitresses falls from 61.5
per cent. to 44.5 per cent. among the Swedes, it
actually rises from 46 per cent. to 48 per cent.
among the Norwegians. Among the former
there is a more eager flight from kitchen to factory.
On the other hand, the affinity of a democratic
people for education reveals itself in the
fact that in both generations the Norwegian
women are decidedly more likely to be teachers
than the Swedish women.</p>


<h4>ASSIMILATION</h4>

<p>It may be true that "every Sunday Norwegian
is preached in more churches in America than in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Norway," still, no immigrants of foreign speech
assimilate so quickly as the Scandinavians.
They never pullulate in slums or stagnate in solid
rural settlements. Of 10,200 families that have
been studied in seven of our great cities, it was
found that the 148 Swedish families had the most
dwellings of five and six rooms, the largest incomes,
the best housekeeping, the best command
of English, and the highest proportion of voters
among the men. The Scandinavians have not
braced themselves against assimilation, as have
the Germans, with their <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutschtum</i>. Not being
beer-bibbers, and warned by their desperate home
struggle, they will not stand with the Teutons
for "personal liberty" on the question of drink.
The anti-liquor sentiment is very strong among
them, and in the Minnesota legislature nearly all
the support for county option is Scandinavian.
Politically, the Norwegians are more active
than the Swedes, and they have been insurgent
ever since they formed in the Northwest
the backbone of so American a movement as Populism.</p>

<p>Among the Scandinavians the spirit of self-improvement
is very strong. No other foreign-born
people respond so eagerly to night-school
opportunities. Farmers' institutes command
better attendance and attention where they
abound than in straight-American neighborhoods.
On a holiday celebration the address attracts
more Scandinavians, the ball-game or the fireworks,
more natives. As patient listeners, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a><br /><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a><br /><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
match our Puritan forefathers. No other people
take more pride in giving their children a chance.
In the words of a Minnesota schoolman, "They
are the best people in the State to appreciate education
and to want it improved." Unlike the
Germans, they have left no mark on American
culture. Our ideas and institutions have not
been changed by their coming. What they have
done is to quicken our interest in the literature of
the North, and to win for it academic recognition.
A department of Scandinavian is found not only
in Harvard and Yale, but also in a dozen universities
all the way from Chicago to Seattle. Even
the high schools in Minneapolis and elsewhere
find place for Scandinavian.</p>

<h4>REACTION TO AMERICA</h4>

<p>The commonplace Knud or Swen brings us a
mind pinched by the petty parochialism of little
countries on the world's byways. Coming from
some valley-closet in a mountainous country,
only three per cent. of which is fit for the
plow, the Norse immigrant is here spiritually enlarged,
like the native of a box-cañon let out into
a plain, or the cove-dweller who comes to live by
the open sea. In a log hut by a lonely fjord in
Trondhjem, or on a dreary moor in Finmark, the
story of a Norse peasant lad rising to be governor
or senator in this country thrills as did, near
a thousand years ago, the romantic tale of some
Varangian back from service in the emperor's
guard at Constantinople.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>In the home-land, a distinguished Norwegian-American,
Dr. Wergeland, finds:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Such an oppressive spiritual atmosphere of narrow-minded
intolerance, of unloving readiness to raise teacup
storms, of insolence, private and political, of clerical
and æsthetic arrogance, that the Norseman, though
scarcely knowing why, longs to get away from it all and
to breathe a fresher, sweeter air. No wonder the people
emigrate. There is a peculiar hardness and inflexibility
in the Norseman's nature, and the mild virtues of forbearance
grow but sparsely in his surroundings. This
is perhaps the reason why the Norse immigrant brings
to his new homestead for the first four or five years
nothing but an open mouth and a silent tongue&mdash;speechless
astonishment. And this is the reason that to come
back to Norway, after spending some years abroad, is
so often like coming from open fields into narrow alleys.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this strain writes a North Dakota pioneer:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What of change the new-comer notices in us American
Norsemen is good manners; the respect shown to
women; the small class distinctions between rich and
poor, high and low; and, finally, the quickness and
practical insight into work and business.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another pioneer, after revisiting Norway,
writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I was often surprised to find that persons who had
never seen me before took me at once for an American.
It seems that even the expression of one's face is greatly
changed here. During this visit I discovered that my
mode of thinking and my spiritual life had changed
so much during my thirteen years in America that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
did not feel quite at home with my childhood friends....
The Norwegian who has lived a while in America
is more civilized than if he had not been here. He has
seen more, experienced more, thought more, and all this
has opened his eyes and broadened his view. He is
more wide-awake, lives a richer life, and is in a closer
correspondence with his surroundings. His sympathies
are widened, and he takes more interest in what is going
on in the world.</p></blockquote>


<h4>CONTRASTS AMONG SCANDINAVIANS</h4>

<p>It will not do to shuffle all our Scandinavians
into one deck. The Danes are courteous and
pleasure-loving, though moody, and they run to
moderation in virtues as in vices. The Swedes
bear the impress of a society that has long known
aristocracy, refinement, and industrialism. They
are more polished in manner than the Norwegians,
although the humble betray a servility which
grates upon Americans. Many show a sociability
and a love of pleasure worthy of "the French
of the North." They bring, too, a love of letters,
and I am told that most of the servant-girls
write verse. The editor of a Swedish weekly
receives very well written poems and contributions
from his readers. Learning stands high
with the Swedes, and since John Ericsson they
have sent us many fine technical men. Only
lately their great chemist Arrhenius hazarded
the prediction that, owing to the tendency of
American men of ability to go into business, our
university chairs will some day be filled with
scholars of German and Scandinavian blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The Swede is more melancholy than the Norseman,
and his letters to friends in the old country
are full of the expression of feeling. He has the
temperament for pietism, which has always been
marked among the Swedish-Americans because
they have been dissenters rather than adherents
of the state church. Formerly the Swedes came
from the country, and were conservative; but of
late they have been coming from the cities, and
are of a radical and even socialistic spirit.</p>

<p>The Norwegian bears the stamp of a more
primitive life. Squeezed into the few roods betwixt
mountains and fjord, he has eked out the
scanty yield of his farm by grazing the high glacier-fed
meadows and gleaning the spoil of the
sea. The need which ten centuries ago drove
the Vikings to harry Europe, to-day forces their
descendants into all the navies of the world.
Granite and frost have made the Norse immigrant
rough-mannered, reserved, and undemonstrative,
cautious in speech, austere in church
life, and little given to recreation. German
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gemüthlichkeit</i> is not in him, nor has he the Irishman's
sociability. Often he is as taciturn as an
Indian, and the lonely farm-houses on the prairie,
where not a needless word is uttered the livelong
day, contribute many young people to the city
maëlstrom.</p>

<p>The Norwegian immigrant has the high spirit
of a people that has never known the steam-roller
of feudalism, of peasants who held their
farms by allodial tenure, and could order the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
king himself off their land. He has more pride
of nationality than the Swede, gets into our politics
sooner, and is more aggressive in improving
his opportunities. He has the name of being
truer to his friends and to his word. Firms declare
that they lose less by his bad debts. "The
Swede," remarks an educator, "will show the
white feather and desert you in a pinch; but not
the Norwegian." A mine "boss" thinks he can
distinguish Scandinavians by type. "The
smooth, white-haired fellows," he says, "have a
yellow streak in them; but the dark, or sandy-haired
fellows, with a rough skin and rugged
features, are reliable." In the Northwest, the
nickname "Norsky" is more apt to be used in a
good-natured way than the term "Swede."</p>


<h4>INTELLECTUAL ABILITY</h4>

<p>Since our editors and public men tender each
nationality of immigrants&mdash;as soon as they have
money and votes&mdash;nothing but lollipops of compliment,
one is loth to proffer the pungent olive
of truth. But it is a fact that many who have to
do with the Americans of Scandinavian parentage
question whether marked ability so often
presents itself among them as among certain
other strains. The weight of testimony indicates
that resourcefulness and intellectual initiative
are rarer among them than among those of German
descent. Teachers find their children
"rather slow," although few fall behind. Scandinavian
students do well, but they are "plodders."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
They beat the Irish in close application,
but less often are they called "brilliant."</p>

<p>Of 19,000 Americans recognized in "Who's
Who in America," 332 were born in Germany,
151 in Ireland, 68 in France, 54 in Sweden, 42 in
Russia, 41 in the Netherlands, 34 in Switzerland,
33 in Austria, 30 in Norway, 28 in Italy, and 14
in Denmark. The Scandinavians have reached
prominence far less often than the French, Dutch,
and Swiss Americans, and not so often even as
the Germans. To the first thousand men of science
in America, our Swedish fellow-citizens contribute
at the rate of 5.2 per million as against
1.8 for the Irish, 7.1 for the Germans, 7.4 for
those born in Russia, and 10.4 for those born in
Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>It is a fair question, then, whether our Scandinavians
represent the flower of their people as well
as the root and stalk. No doubt in venturesomeness
they surpass those in like circumstances who
stayed at home. No doubt they brought in full
measure the forceful character of the race; but,
thanks to our bland, syrupy way of appraising
the naturalized foreign-born, the question of
comparative brain power never comes up.</p>

<p>Now, oppression or persecution had very little
to do with the outflow from Scandinavia. The
immigrants came for a better living, for, in the
main, they have been servants and common laborers,
with a sprinkling of small farmers and a
fair contingent of craftsmen. We have had very
few representatives of the classes enjoying access<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to higher education, business, the professions,
and the public service. Having fair prospects at
home, the more capable families very likely contributed
fewer emigrants than the rest. A professor
of Swedish parentage tells me that he has
noticed that the successful Swedes he meets traveling
in this country are wholly different in physiognomy
from the immigrants. The faces here
strike him as duller and less regular than the
faces of people in Sweden. Other Swedish-Americans,
however, contend that formerly caste
barriers in the fatherland so blocked the rise of
gifted commoners that the immigrant stream is
as rich in natural ability as is the Swedish people
at home. Rugged Norway has less to hold at
home the more capable stocks; but still one meets
with candid Norwegian-Americans who think our
million of Norse blood represent the brawn rather
than the brain of their folk.</p>


<h4>MENTAL AND PRACTICAL TRAITS</h4>

<p>Norse mythology is to Celtic mythology what
a Yukon forest is to an Orinoco jungle. In
the Sagas of Iceland the fancy never runs riot as
it does in the legends of Connemara or Brittany.
It is not surprising, then, that our Scandinavians
are not distinguished for visual imagination.
Professors notice that the lads of this breed are
slow to grasp the principle of the machinery
about the college of agriculture, and need a diagram
to supplement oral description of a ventilating
system. To them even a drawing is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
maze of lines rather than a picture. A physical
director working among Scandinavians labored
in vain to get his trustees to imagine from the
blue prints how the new gymnasium would look.
Not until the scaffolding was down were his gymnasts
satisfied that there would be "room to do
the giant swing." His boy scouts had no faith in
a selected camp-site till the brush was actually
cleared from it. They lacked "the mind's eye."</p>

<p>"It is not enough," remarks a settlement head,
"to show rich Nils or Lars 'how the other half
lives'; you've got to clinch your appeal by showing
him how the other half <em>ought</em> to live." Says
a social worker, "I picture to the poor Slovak an
eight-room, steam-heated house as a goal, and he
will work for it; but the poor Swede can't imagine
such a house as his own, so I have to talk to
him of the four-room house he will one day possess."</p>

<p>It is said that, as merchant, the Scandinavian
puts little visualizing into his advertisements,
and is slow to catch the vision of a community
prosperity through team-work. As business
man, he is a "stand-patter," able to run a going
concern, but without the American's power to
anticipate developments and to plant a business
where none exists. As farmer, he is not so far-sighted
as the German. He will burn off the
growth on his cut-over land till the humus has
been consumed, or wear out his fields with some
profitable but exhausting crop, like tobacco. As
investor, he is the opposite of the imaginative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a><br /><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a><br /><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
speculative American, for large, remote profits
do not appeal to him. As labor leader, he lacks
vision and idealism. On the stump he does not
address the imagination as does the Hibernian
spellbinder. As advocate, he makes a hard-headed
plea without sentiment, and as after-dinner
speaker he lacks in wit and fancy.</p>

<p>So little sociable are the Scandinavians that it
is said "ice-water runs in their veins." Even
liquor will not start the current of fraternal feeling.
They care little for the social side of their
labor-unions, and neglect the regular meetings.
They do not warm up to an employer who treats
them "right." Without the happy art of mixing
and fraternizing, these sons of the North do not
shine as bar-tenders, salesmen, canvassers, commercial
travelers, or life-insurance solicitors. As
street-car conductors in Minneapolis they are
said to be less helpful and polite than the American
or the Irish conductors of St. Paul. Teachers
of this blood do not easily attach their pupils
to them; while the children, instead of being inspired
by an audience, as are the Irish, become
tongue-tied. Often one hears a teacher lament,
"I can't get anything <em>out</em> of them."</p>

<p>There is sweetness in the Scandinavian nature,
but you reach it deep down past flint. The late
Governor Johnson of Minnesota drew people because
he had imagination and tenderness&mdash;traits
none too common among his people. They are
undemonstrative in the family, and it is not surprising
that their youth on the farms are restless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
from heart-hunger. Besides, there is dearth
of recreation. The Norwegian has his violin, but
the Swedish folk-dances we hear so much about
were not brought in by the immigrants. They
lack the German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Männerchor</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Turnverein</i>, and
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schuetzenfest</i>. It is unusual to find them organizing
athletic sports. Their social gatherings
center in the church, which of course acts as a
damper on the spirits of the young. They love
fun, to be sure, but have not the knack of making
it. Shut up within themselves, hard to reach,
slow to kindle, and dominated by an austere hell-fire
theology, they are too often the prey of somber
moods and victims of suicide and insanity.</p>

<p>An experienced social worker finds selfishness
the besetting sin of the Scandinavians he deals
with. If a settlement class get a room or a
camp, they object to any others using it. In any
undertaking they have in common with other nationalities
they try to get the best for themselves.
They withhold aid from the distressed of another
nationality, while the Irish will respond generously
to the same appeal. A labor leader notices
that the Scandinavian working-men are "hard
givers." A kindergartener who sent out Christmas
gifts to twenty poor Scandinavian families
received thanks from only one. A society gave
relief to 260 such families during the winter, and
the number who expressed gratitude could be
counted on the fingers of one hand. One clergyman
declared that his people are not generous in
supporting their own charities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, an observer remarks:
"For a suffering <em>person</em>, circulate your subscription
paper among the Irish; for a good <em>cause</em>, circulate
it among the Scandinavians." In other
words, the goodness of these people is from the
head rather than from the heart. "If I can get
him to see it as his <em>duty</em>," testifies a charity
worker, "the Scandinavian will go almost any
length." Credit men rank them with the Germans
as the surest pay. Insurance agents say no
other people are so faithful in paying their premiums
"on the nail." If there is a suspicious
fire in a store, the owner's name never ends in
"son." In Minnesota there are more coöperative
stores, creameries, and elevators in the
Scandinavian communities than in the American.</p>

<p>The Norwegians have been virile politically,
and their politics has reflected moral ideas. They
look upon public office as a trust, not a means of
livelihood. In the days of Populism they were
more open-minded than the Americans. In
Wisconsin they have furnished a stanch support
for the constructive policies which have drawn
upon that State national attention. In the critical
roll-calls in the Minnesota legislature all but
one or two of the Scandinavian members are
found on the "right side." The "interests"
have the Germans,&mdash;brewing being an "interest,"&mdash;the
Irish, and many Americans.</p>

<p>The truth is, their slow reaction gives these
people the right psychology for self-government.
In politics they are "good losers." They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
not to be stampeded by fiery rhetoric or mass
hysteria. They have the self-control to right
abuses by orderly constitutional methods. In the
Chicago anarchist trials the defense was careful
to keep Scandinavians out of the jury-box.
Among the Scandinavian peoples riots, barricades,
and street turbulence have played no part
in the redress of political grievances. Ideas of
right lie at the base of their social order, while
habit and sentiment count for less than they do
among South Europeans. So, while our Scandinavian
strain may lack the qualities for political
leadership, it provides an excellent, cool-blooded,
self-controlled citizenship for the support
of representative government.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE ITALIANS</h3>


<p>The immigration from Italy has shot up like
Jonah's gourd. During the last decade a
fourth of our immigrants have been Italians, and
from being a twentieth part of our foreign-born,
they have risen to be a tenth. This freshet is not
born of religious or political oppression, for Italy
enjoys a government on modern lines, created by
the efforts of patriots like Mazzini, Cavour, and
Garibaldi. The impulse that every year prompts
from a quarter to a half of a million Italians to
wander oversea is purely economic. Ignorance
and the subjection of women cause blind multiplication,
with the result that the Italians are wresting
their food from narrower plots than any other
European people. A population approximating
that of all our Atlantic States is trying to live
from a space little greater than the combined
areas of New York and Georgia. Although
Argentina seconds the United States in absorbing
the overflow, still, Italy's population continually
swells, her birth-rate is not sinking so
rapidly as her death-rate, and one sees no reason
why the Italian dusk should not in time quench
what of the Celto-Teutonic flush lingers in the
cheek of the native American.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>


<h4>DISTRIBUTION THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES</h4>

<p>Of our one and one-third million of Italians,
the Northeast down to Washington holds about
three-fourths, while south and southwest of the
Capitol there are only three and a half per cent.
The middle West has sixteen per cent., and the
quota of the Far West is seven and a half per cent.
For the most part, they are greatly concentrated
in cities. Roughly speaking, five-sixths of the
Italians in Delaware are in Wilmington; in Maryland,
three-sevenths are in Baltimore; in Illinois,
three-eights are in Chicago; in Nebraska, two-thirds
are in Omaha; in Missouri, three-fifths are
in St. Louis; in Oregon, one-half are in Portland;
in Pennsylvania, one-half are in Philadelphia; in
Louisiana, two-fifths are in New Orleans; in
Michigan, a third are in Detroit; and in Ohio, a
quarter are in Cleveland. In New York city are
massed a third of a million of Italians, one-fourth
of all in the country. Although a slow percolation
into the rural districts is going on, this current
distributes immigrants very differently from
the older streams that debouched on the advancing
frontier.</p>


<h4>SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS</h4>

<p>Migratory job-hunters rather than home-seekers,
the Italians are loath to encumber themselves
with their women. The women are only a
little more than one-fifth of the whole, nor do they
come here more freely as time goes on. A natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
consequence of leaving families behind is a
huge return current <em>to</em> Italy, amounting to a third
of the arrivals <em>from</em> Italy.</p>

<p>More than half of our British immigrants are
skilled. Of the Italian arrivals, one out of eight
is skilled, one out of four is a farm-laborer, one
out of three is a common laborer, and one in two
hundred and fifty has a profession. In a word,
two-thirds are of rural origin. The illiteracy of
the Italian immigrants more than fourteen years
of age is forty-seven per cent.; so that of the two
million illiterates admitted to this country
1899-1909, nearly one-half hailed from Italy.</p>


<h4>NORTH ITALIANS AND SOUTH ITALIANS</h4>

<p>The fact that the emigrants from the north of
Italy wander chiefly to South America, where industrially
they dominate, while the emigrants
from central and southern Italy come to this
country, where they are dominated, makes it important
to remember that in race advancement
the North Italians differ from the rest of their
fellow-countrymen. In the veins of the broadhead
people of Piedmont, Lombardy, and Venetia
runs much Northern blood&mdash;Celtic, Gothic, Lombard,
and German. The other Italians are of the
long-head, dark, Mediterranean race, with no
small infusion of Greek, Saracen, and African
blood in the Calabrians and Sicilians. Rarely is
there so wide an ethnic gulf between the geographical
extremes of a nation as there is between
Milan and Palermo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The Italians themselves have set forth these
contrasts in the sharpest relief. In an elaborate
treatise, Professor Niceforo shows that blue eyes
and fair hair occur twice as often among the
North Italians as among the people south of
Rome; that their understatured are eight per cent.
of the whole as against twenty per cent. for the
South Italians; and that they show a greater
frequency of high foreheads and a smaller frequency
of low brows. They have a third of the
illiteracy of the South, twice the school attendance,
thrice the number of higher students; and
while a clear third of the southern students fail
in their examinations, less than a quarter of the
northerners fail. Northern Italy is twice as well
off in teachers and libraries, five times as productive
in book publishing, has twice as many
voters to the hundred inhabitants, and buys half
as many lottery-tickets as the South. The astonishing
dearth of literary and artistic production
in the South ought to confound those optimists
who, identifying "Italian" with "Venetian" and
"Tuscan," anticipate that the Italian infusion
will one day make the American stock bloom with
poets and painters. The figures of Niceforo show
that the provinces that contribute most to our immigration
<em>have been utterly sterile in creators of
beauty</em>.</p>

<p>In nothing are the two peoples so unlike as in
their crimes. While northern Italy leads in
fraud and chicane, southern Italy reveals a rank
growth of the ferocious crimes that go with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
primitive stage of civilization. The contrast is
between force and fraud, violence and cunning.
The South produces five times as much homicide
as the North, four times as much brigandage, three
times as many assaults, and five times as many
seizures or destructions of property. On the
whole, it has from three to four times the violence
of the North, while its obscene crimes, which constitute
an index of sensuality, are thrice as numerous.
As for Sicilians, they are scourged by
seven times the homicide, four times the brigandage,
and four times the obscene crime suffered
by an equal number of North Italians.</p>

</div>

<p>Although less advanced, the Italians from the
valley of the Po are racially akin to the Swiss and
the South Germans. As immigrants, their superiority
to other Italians is generally recognized.
I have yet to meet an observer who does
not rate the North Italian among us as more intelligent,
reliable, and progressive than the
South Italian. We know from statistics that
he is less turbulent, less criminal, less transient;
he earns more, rises higher, and acquires citizenship
sooner. Yet only a fifth of our Italians are
from the North. It is the backward and benighted
provinces from Naples to Sicily that send
us the flood of "gross little aliens" who gave
Henry James, on revisiting Boston, the melancholy
vision "of a huge applied sponge&mdash;a sponge
saturated with the foreign mixture and passed
over almost everything I remembered and might
still have recovered."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>


<h4>VARIETY OF OCCUPATIONS</h4>

<p>Being new-comers, the Italians are doing the
heavy, unskilled work which was once the prerogative
of the Irish. The shovel is now as firmly associated
in our minds with 'Tonio as formerly with
Barney. The North Italians go much into
mine and quarry and silk-mill, but the others stick
close to railroad, street, and construction work.
Of our railroads it has been said that "Italians
build them, Irish run them, and Jews own them."
Nearer to the truth, perhaps, is the New York <i>mot</i>,
"Houses nowadays are built by Italians, owned
by Jews, and paid for by Irish tenants." Being
small and vegetarian, the Italians are not preferred
in earthwork for their physical strength,
but because of their endurance of heat, cold, wet,
and muck. As one contractor puts it, "they can
stand the gaff."</p>

<p>Although the South Italians are numerous
in the manufacture of boots and shoes, cigars,
glass, woolen goods, and clothing, some employers
refuse the males for "inside work" because they
have the reputation of being turbulent. Their
noteworthy absence from the rolling-mills is attributed
to the fact that they lack the nervous
stability needed for seizing a white-hot piece of
iron with a pair of tongs. The phlegmatic Slav
stands up to such work.</p>

<p>In the trades, the Italians crop up numerously
as bakers, barbers, cobblers, confectioners, tailors,
street musicians, scissors-grinders and marble-cutters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
A great number become hucksters and
peddlers of such characteristic wares as fruits and
plaster casts. It is the Italian from the North,
especially the Genoese, who brings native commercial
capacity and becomes a wholesale or commission
merchant in fruits and vegetables, while
the Neapolitan is still fussing with his banana-stand.
Thanks to their race genius, the Italian
musicians and teachers of music among us bid
fair to break the musical monopoly of the German-Americans.</p>

<p>In one province of southern Italy not a plow
exists, and the women wield the hand implements
beside the men. It is not strange that immigrants
with such experience do well here in truck-farming
and market-gardening. Those who engage in
real agriculture settle chiefly in colonies, for the
voluble, gregarious Italians cannot endure the
chill loneliness of the American homestead. They
follow their bent for intensive farming, and would
hardly know how to handle more than fifteen or
twenty acres. Few of them are up to ordinary
extensive farming. As one observer says, "They
haven't the head for it."</p>

<p>Although Italians are making a living on the
cut-over pine-lands of northern Wisconsin, the
rocky hills of New England, the sandy barrens of
New Jersey, and the muck soil of western New
York, their love of sunshine is not dead. The
cane, cotton, and tobacco fields of the South attract
them. More than half of the Italians in
Louisiana are on the plantations. Half of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
sixty thousand in California are in vineyard and
orchard. The famed Italian-Swiss colony at
Asti employs a thousand men to help it make wine
under a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cielo sereno</i> like that of Italy. Many a
fisherman who has cast his net in the Gulf of
Genoa now strains the waters of San Francisco
Bay.</p>

<p>There are two-score rural colonies of Italians in
the South, and the settlements at Bryan, Texas,
and Sunnyside and Tontitown, Arkansas, are well
known. Italians have been welcomed to the South
by planters dissatisfied with negro labor or desirous
of deriving a return from their raw land.
As a cotton raiser, the Italian has excelled the
negro at every point. When it was found, however,
that thrifty Pietro insisted on buying land
after his second crop as tenant, whereas the black
tenant will go on forever letting his superintending
white landlord draw an income from him, the
enthusiasm of the planters cooled. Then, too, a
fear has sprung up lest the Italians, being without
the southern white man's strong race feeling,
should mix with the negroes and create a hybrid.
The South, therefore, is less eager for Italian immigrants
than it was, and the legislatures of North
Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia have recorded
their sense of the undesirableness of this
element.</p>


<h4>CHARACTERISTIC VICES</h4>

<p>The peoples from the Azores to Armenia are
well-nigh immune to the seduction of alcohol; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
that if this be the test of desirableness, it will be
easy to part the sheep from the goats. Certain
American sentimentalists go into raptures over
the "sobriety" of the new immigrants, and to such
we may as well concede first as last that there
would be no liquor problem here if abstemious
Portuguese had landed at Jamestown instead of
hard-drinking English; if temperate Rumanians
had settled the colonies instead of thirsty Germans
and Scotch-Irish; and if sober, coffee-drinking
Turks had peopled the West instead of
bibulous Hibernians and Scandinavians. The
proportion of Italian charity cases due to drink is
only a sixth of that for foreign-born cases, and a
seventh of that for cases among native Americans.
Alcoholics occur among the Italians in the charity
hospitals from a tenth to a twentieth as often as
among North Europeans. Still, American example
and American strain are telling on the
habits of the Italians, and in the Italian home
the bottle of "rock and rye" is seen with increasing
frequency by the side of the bottle of Chianti.</p>

<p>Bachelors in the pick-and-shovel brigade will
have their diversions, so it is not surprising that
the Italians, like the abstemious Chinese, are addicted
to gambling. Games of chance flourish in
their saloons, and many a knife-thrust has come
out of a game of cards. At home the state lottery
has whetted the taste for gambling. In the
Neapolitan the intoxication of the lottery takes
the place occupied by alcoholic intoxication in the
Anglo-Saxon. When one learns that on an average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the Neapolitan risks $3.15 a year in the lottery,
six times as much as the average Italian, one
does not wonder that the immigrant hankers to
put his money on something.</p>


<h4>VIOLENCE IN CRIME</h4>

<p>For all the great majority of the Italian immigrants
are peaceable and industrious, no other
element matches them in propensity for personal
violence. In homicide, rape, blackmail, and kidnapping
they lead the foreign-born. Says the Immigration
Commission: "The Italian criminals
are largest in numbers and create most alarm by
the violent character of their offenses in this country."
Among moderns, gainful offenses occur
from three to seven times as frequently as crimes
of violence. The medievalism of the South
Italians appears from the fact that they commit
more deeds of personal violence than gainful offenses.</p>

<p>Browning, who knew the Italians, expresses this
cheerful alacrity in murder when, in "The Ring
and the Book," the <i>Pope</i> tells of the four "bright-eyed,
black-haired boys" <i>Count Guido</i> hired for
his bloody work:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Murder me some three people, old and young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye never heard the names of&mdash;and be paid<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Demur? Do cattle bidden march or halt?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All is done purely for the pay&mdash;which earned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not forthcoming at the instant, makes<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Religion heresy, and the lord o' the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fit subject for a murder in his turn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The patron with cut throat and rifled purse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deposited i' the roadside ditch, his due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naught hinders each good fellow trudging home<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And so with new zest to the common life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mattock and spade, plow-tail and wagon-shaft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till some such other piece of luck betide.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was frequently stated to the members of the
Immigration Commission in southern Italy that
crime had greatly diminished in many communities
because most of the criminals had gone to
America. One Italian official at Messina stated
that several years ago southern Italy was a hot-bed
of crime, but that now very few criminals
were left. When asked as to their whereabouts,
he replied, "Why, they are all in the United
States." From the Camorra, that vast spider-web
of thieves and prostitutes by whom life and
politics in Naples are controlled, have come thousands
who find the hard-working Italian immigrants
a richer field of exploitation than any field
open at home. Still more harassing is the Mafia,
by means of which Sicilians contrive to ignore
police and courts and to secure justice in their
own way. A legacy of Spanish domination and
Spanish arrogance is the sense of <i>omertà</i>, or manliness,
which holds it dastardly to betray to justice
even one's deadliest foe. To avenge one's
wrongs oneself, and never to appeal to law, is a
part of Sicilian honor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>In an Italian quarter are men who never work,
yet who have plenty of money. "No," they say,
"we do not work. Work does not agree with us.
We have friends who work and give us money.
Why not?" It is these parasites who commit
most of the crime. Their honest fellow-countrymen
shrink from them, yet, if one of them is arrested,
some make it a point of honor to swear
him off, while all scrupulously forget anything
against him. Thanks to this perverse idea of
"honor," an Italian murder may be committed in
the street in broad daylight, with dozens looking
on, yet a few minutes later every spectator will
deny to the police that he has seen anything. This
highbinder contempt for law is reinforced by sheer
terrorism. It is said that often in our courts the
sudden wilting of a promising Italian witness has
been brought about by the secret giving of the
"death-sign," a quick passing of the hand across
the throat as if cutting.</p>

<p>The American, with his ready resort to the
vigilance committee, is amazed that a whole community
should let itself thus be bullied by a few
miscreants known to all. Nothing of the sort has
ever been tolerated by North European immigrants.
The secret lies in the inaptness of the
South Italians for good team work. Individualistic
to the marrow, they lack the gift of pulling
together, and have never achieved an efficient cooperating
unit larger than the family.</p>

<p>General Theodore E. Bingham, former Police
Commissioner of New York, estimated that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a><br /><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a><br /><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
are in that city not less than 3000 desperadoes
from southern Italy, "among them as many ferocious
and desperate men as ever gathered in a
modern city in time of peace&mdash;medieval criminals
who must be dealt with under modern law." In
1908 he stated: "Crimes of blackmailing, blowing
up of shops and houses, and kidnapping of
their countrymen have become prevalent among
Italian residents of the city to an extent that cannot
be much longer tolerated." It is obvious that
if our legal system is called upon to cope with a
great volume of such crime for a long time, it
will slough off certain Anglo-Saxon features and
adopt the methods which alone avail in Italy,
namely, state police, registry system, "special surveillance"
and "admonition."</p>

</div>


<h4>ASSIMILATION WITH AMERICANS</h4>

<p>Not being transients, the North Italians do
not resist Americanizing influences. The Genoese,
for example, come not to earn wages, but to
engage in business. They shun the Italian
"quarter," mix with Americans, and Anglicize
their names. Mariani becomes Merriam; Abata
turns to Abbey; Garberino softens to Gilbert;
while Campana suffers a "sea change" into Bell.
In the produce-markets they deal with Americans,
and as high-class saloon-keepers they are forging
past Michael and Gustaf.</p>

<p>But the South Italians remain nearly as
aloof as did the Cantonese who built the Central
Pacific Railway. Navvies who leave for Naples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
when the ground freezes, and return in April, who
huddle in a "camp" or a box-car, or herd on some
"Dago Flat," are not really <em>in</em> America. In a
memorial to the acting mayor of New York, the
Italian-American Civic League speaks of the
"great civically inert mass" of their countrymen
in New York, and declares, "By far the largest
part of the Italians of this city have lived a life
of their own, almost entirely apart from the
American environment." "In one street," writes
Signor Pecorini, "will be found peasants from
one Italian village; in the next street the place of
origin is different, and distinct are manners, customs,
and sympathies. Entire villages have been
transplanted from Italy to one New York street,
and with the others have come the doctor, the
grocer, the priest, and the annual celebration of
the local patron saint."</p>

<p>Among the foreign-born, the Italians rank lowest
in adhesion to trade-unions, lowest in ability
to speak English, lowest in proportion naturalized
after ten years' residence, lowest in proportion of
children in school, and highest in proportion of
children at work. Taking into account the innumerable
"birds of passage" without family or
future in this country, it would be safe to say that
half, perhaps two-thirds, of our Italian immigrants
are <em>under</em> America, not <em>of</em> it. Far from
being borne along with our onward life, they drift
round and round in a "Little Italy" eddy, or lie
motionless in some industrial pocket or crevice at
the bottom of the national current.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>


<h4>LACK OF MENTAL ABILITY</h4>

<p>Steerage passengers from a Naples boat show
a distressing frequency of low foreheads, open
mouths, weak chins, poor features, skew faces,
small or knobby crania, and backless heads. Such
people lack the power to take rational care of
themselves; hence their death-rate in New York
is twice the general death-rate and thrice that of
the Germans. No other immigrants from Europe,
unless it be the Portuguese or the half-African
Bravas of the Azores, show so low an earning
power as the South Italians. In our cities the
head of the household earns on an average $390 a
year, as against $449 for the North Italian,
$552 for the Bohemian, and $630 for the German.
In silk-mill and wollen-mill, in iron-ore mining and
the clothing trade, no other nationality has so
many low-pay workers; nor does this industrial
inferiority fade out in the least with the lapse of
time.</p>

<p>Their want of mechanical aptitude is often noticed.
For example, in a New England mill
manned solely by South Italians only one out
of fifteen of the extra hands taken on during the
"rush" season shows sufficient aptitude to be
worth keeping. The operatives require closer
supervision than Americans, and each is given
only one thing to do, so as to put the least possible
strain on his attention.</p>

<p>If it be demurred that the ignorant, superstitious
Neapolitan or Sicilian, heir to centuries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Bourbon misgovernment, cannot be expected to
prove us his race mettle, there are his children,
born in America. What showing do they make?
Teachers agree that the children of the South
Italians rank below the children of the North
Italians. They hate study, make slow progress,
and quit school at the first opportunity. While
they take to drawing and music, they are poor in
spelling and language and very weak in abstract
mathematics. In the words of one superintendent,
"they lack the conveniences for thinking."
More than any other children, they fall behind
their grade. They are below even the Portuguese
and the Poles, while at the other extremity stand
the children of the Scandinavians and the Hebrews.
The explanation of the difference is not
irregularity of attendance, for among pupils attending
three fourths of the time, or more, the percentage
of South Italians retarded is fifty-six
as against thirty-seven and a half per cent. for
the Russian-Hebrew children and twenty-nine per
cent. for the German. Nor is it due to the father's
lack of American experience, for of the children
of South Italians who have been in this country
ten or more years sixty per cent. are backward,
as against about half that proportion
among the Hebrews and the Germans. After allowing
for every disturbing factor, it appears
that these children, with the dusk of Saracenic or
Berber ancestors showing in their cheeks, are
twice as apt to drop behind other pupils of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a><br /><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a><br /><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
age as are the children of the non-English-speaking
immigrants from northern Europe.</p>

<h4>TRAITS OF ITALIAN CHARACTER</h4>

<p>The South Italian is volatile, unstable, soon
hot, soon cool. Says one observer, "The Italian
vote here is a joke. Every candidate claims it because
they were 'for' him when he saw them. But
the man who talks last to them gets their vote."
A charity worker declares that they change their
minds "three steps after they have left you." It
is not surprising that such people are unreliable.
Credit men pronounce them "very slippery," and
say that the Italian merchants themselves do not
extend credit to them. It is generally agreed that
the South Italians lie more easily than North
Europeans, and utter untruth without that
self-consciousness which makes us awkward liars.
"Most of my countrymen," says an educated
Italian in the consular service of his country, "disregard
their promises unless it is to their advantage
to keep them." The man who "sweareth to
his own hurt and changeth not" is likely to be a
German with his ideal of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Treue</i>, an Englishman
with his ideal of <em>truth</em>, or an American with his
ideal of <em>squareness</em>.</p>

<p>The Italians are sociable. Who can forget the
joyous, shameless gregariousness of Naples? As
farmers they cluster, and seem to covet the intimacies
of the tenement-house. The streets of an
Italian quarter are lively with chatter and stir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and folks sitting out in front and calling to one
another. In their family life they are much less
reserved than many other nationalities. With instinctive
courtesy they make the visitor welcome,
and their quick and demonstrative response to
kindly advances makes them many friends.
Visiting nurses comment on the warm expressions
of gratitude they receive from the children of
Italians whom they have helped.</p>

<p>Before the boards of inquiry at Ellis Island
their emotional instability stands out in the sharpest
contrast to the self-control of the Hebrew and
the stolidity of the Slav. They gesticulate much,
and usually tears stand in their eyes. When two
witnesses are being examined, both talk at once,
and their hands will be moving all the time. Their
glances flit quickly from one questioner to another,
and their eyes are the restless, uncomprehending
eyes of the desert Bedouin between walls.
Yet for all this eager attention, they are slow to
catch the meaning of a simple question, and often
it must be repeated.</p>

<p>Mindful of these darting eyes and hands, one
does not wonder that the Sicilian will stab his best
friend in a sudden quarrel over a game of cards.
The Slavs are ferocious in their cups, but none is
so ready with his knife when sober as the South
Italian. In railroad work other nationalities
shun camps with many Italians. Contractors are
afraid of them because the whole force will impulsively
quit work, perhaps flare into riot, if they
imagine one of their number has suffered a wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>The principal of a school with four hundred
Sicilian pupils observes that on the playground
they are at once more passionate and more vindictive
than other children. Elsewhere, once discipline
has been established, "the school will run
itself"; but in this school the teacher "has to sit
on the lid all the time." Their restlessness keeps
the truant officer busy, and their darting, flickering
attention denies them concentration and the
steady, telling stroke. For all their apparent
brightness, when at fourteen they quit school, they
are rarely beyond the third or fourth grade.</p>

<p>As grinding rusty iron reveals the bright metal,
so American competition brings to light the race
stuff in poverty-crushed immigrants. But not all
this stuff is of value in a democracy like ours.
Only a people endowed with a steady attention, a
slow-fuse temper, and a persistent will can organize
itself for success in the international rivalries
to come. So far as the American people consents
to incorporate with itself great numbers of wavering,
excitable, impulsive persons who cannot organize
themselves, it must in the end resign itself
to lower efficiency, to less democracy, or to both.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE SLAVS</h3>


<p>In the dim east of Europe, far from the vertical
beams of civilization, lies the melancholy
Slavic world, with its 150,000,000 of human beings
multiplying twice as fast and dying twice as fast
as the peoples of the West. Since the curtain of
history rose, the Slavs have been anvil rather than
hammer. Subjugated by the Gauls in the first
century B. C., by the Germans early in the Christian
era, and by the Avars in the sixth century,
they have played no master rôle in history and
their very name is a conqueror's insult. In the
temper of this race there appears to be something
soft and yielding. For all their courage, these
peaceful agriculturists have shown much less of
the fighting, retaliating instinct than the Britons
and the Norsemen.</p>

<p>At a time when western Europe was sending
forth armies to rescue the Holy Sepulcher much of
Slavland lay still in heathen darkness. Human
sacrifices and the practice of <em>suttee</em> did not disappear
until the adoption of Christianity. Helmold,
a priest of Lübeck, who in 1158 was sent to
Christianize the Slavs, speaks of them as a "depraved
and perverse nation," and their country is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a><br /><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a><br /><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
to him "a land of horror and a vast solitude."
In 1108 the Archbishop of Magdeburg writes in a
pastoral letter, "These cruel people, the Slavs,
have risen against us."... "They have cut off
the heads of Christians and offered them as sacrifices."</p>

</div>

<p>Unlike the maritime peoples of the West, the
Slavs had no easement from the colonizing of the
New World. When the era of machine industry
dawned, they were not able, as were the English,
the French, and the Germans, to get into the sunshine
by catering to the world's demand for cheap
manufactured goods. Moreover, they have had
to bear the brunt of Oriental onslaught. The
South Slavs&mdash;of Servia, Bulgaria, Herzegovina,
and Macedonia&mdash;fell under those Comanches of
Asia, the Turks, so that only within the last thirty-five
years have the spires and turrets of their
submerged civilization reappeared above the receding
Ottoman flood.</p>

<p>While the Bohemians and the Moravians, thanks
to a great intellectual awakening, have come
nearly abreast of the Germans, the bulk of the
Slavs remain on a much lower plane of culture.
In ignorance and illiteracy, in the prevalence of
superstition and priestcraft, in the harshness of
church and state, in the subservience of the common
people to the upper classes, in the low position
of woman, in the subjection of the child to the
parent, in coarseness of manner and speech, and
in low standards of cleanliness and comfort, a
large part of the Slavic world remains at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
level of our English forefathers in the days of
Henry the Eighth.</p>

<p>According to mother-tongue, there were in this
country in 1910, 941,000 Poles, 228,000 Bohemians
and Moravians, 165,000 Slovaks from the southern
slopes of the Carpathians, 123,000 Slovenes from
the head of the Adriatic, 78,000 Croatians and
Dalmatians, 56,000 Russians, 40,000 Bulgarians,
Servians, and Montenegrins, 30,000 Slavonians,
25,000 Ruthenians, to say nothing of 140,000
Lithuanians and Letts, who insist that they are a
race apart. All told, there are 2,000,000 Slavs
among us, and, if we heed the estimates of the
leaders of the Slav groups, we should reckon at
least 3,000,000. No doubt, between five and six
per cent. of the whites in this country are of Slavic
blood.</p>

<p>Of the Slav arrivals since 1899 nearly three-fourths
are males. Among the immigrants from
the Balkans, the men are from ten to twenty times
as numerous as the women. Thirty-two per cent.
have been illiterates, the proportion ranging from
1.7 per cent. among the Bohemians to 53.4 per
cent. among the Ruthenians. Excepting the Bohemians,
few of them have had any industrial experience
or bring any valuable skill. It is as if
great numbers of the English of the sixteenth century
had suddenly appeared among us.</p>


<h4>OCCUPATIONS OF THE SLAVIC IMMIGRANTS</h4>

<p>When, about fifteen years ago, the great Slav
invasion began, the American frontier was remote,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
shrunken, and forbidding. The newcomers were
not in quest of cheap land, with independence, so
much as of paying jobs from which they might
hoard "big money" and return well off to their
homes. They gravitated, therefore, to the mining,
metal-working, and packing centers, where
there is a demand for unlimited quantities of raw
labor, provided always it be cheap. So these
sturdy peasant lads came to be Nibelungs, "sons
of the gloom," haunting our coal-pits, blast-furnaces,
coke-ovens, smelters, foundries, steel-mills,
and metal refineries, doing rough, coarse work
under skilled men who, as one foreman put it to
me, "don't want them to <em>think</em>, but to <em>obey
orders</em>."</p>

<p>What irony that these peasants, straight from
ox-goad and furrow, should come to constitute,
so far as we can judge from official figures, three-fifths
of the force in sugar refining, two-fifths of
the force in meat-packing, three-eighths of the
labor in tanneries and in oil refineries, one-third
of the coal-miners and of the iron- and steel-workers,
one-fourth of the workers in carpet-mills, and
one-fifth of the hands in the clothing trade! On
the other hand, they are but one-seventh of the
labor force in the glass-factories and in the cotton-mills,
one-ninth of the employees in copper-mining
and smelting (who are largely Finns),
one-twelfth of our railway labor, and only a handful
in the silk and woolen industries.</p>

<p>For these manful Slavs, no work is too toilsome
and dangerous. Their fatalistic acceptance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
risk has much to do with the excessive blood-cost
of certain of our industries. They are not "old
clo'" men, junk-dealers, hucksters, peddlers, and
snappers-up of unconsidered trifles, as are some
of the people among us. They have no nose for
the small, parasitic trades, but with a splendid
work courage they tackle the heavy, necessary
tasks. Large of body, hard-muscled, and inexpert
in making his head save his heels, the Slav inevitably
becomes the unskilled laborer in the basic
industries.</p>

<p>Unlike the Teutons and Scandinavians of the
eighties, whose chief location was the country beyond
Chicago, the later Slavs have been drawn to
Pennsylvania, in the hard-coal fields and the Pittsburgh
district, and thence they have spread to the
rising mining and metal-working centers throughout
the country. So many are single men that
they form an extraordinarily mobile labor force,
willing to go anywhere for an extra two cents an
hour. Although they do not build homes, and
hence are dependent upon such housing as they
can find, they do not stagnate in slums, save as
the conditions of their employment impose congestion.</p>

<p>Bohemians and Poles come here to stay, so it is
they who furnish the farmers. The Bohemian
current began as far back as the fifties, and in
1900 a quarter of all the Bohemian-Americans
were on the land. The Poles came later, and with
less money, so that only one-tenth were then in
agriculture. The immigrants of the seventies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
sought wild, cheap land, and therefore the Slav
settlements are thickest in the Northwest and the
Southwest. One-third of all the Polish farmers
are in Wisconsin, while in Texas Bohemian cotton-growers
are so numerous that in some localities
even the negroes speak Bohemian! Of late raw
Poles, working up through farm labor and tenancy,
are coming to own "abandoned farms" in
the Connecticut Valley. Crowded with several
other families in an old Yankee farm-house, the
Pole is raising, with the aid of his numerous
progeny, incredible crops of onions and tobacco.
"In old Hadley," reports Professor Emily Balch
of Wellesley College, "all up and down the beautiful
elm-shaded street the old colonial mansions
are occupied by Poles." In one year these Poles,
who were but one-fifth of the population, accounted
for two-thirds of the births.</p>


<h4>EXCESSIVE ALCOHOLISM AMONG THE SLAVS</h4>

<p>Coming from an Elizabethan world, the Slav is
as frankly vinous as Falstaff with his "cup o'
sack." He is a Bacchus worshiper unashamed,
and our squeamishness about liquor strikes him
as either hypocrisy or prudery. He thinks, too,
that without stimulant he cannot stand up to the
grueling work of mill and mine. A steel-worker,
when besought to give up drink, replied, "No beer,
no whisky, me no work." Hence an incredible
amount of his wages goes to line the till of the
saloon-keeper. In a steel town of 30,000 population,
$60,000 are left with the saloon-keepers the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Saturday and Sunday after pay-day. The Saturday
brewery-wagon makes the rounds, and
on a pleasant Sunday one sees in the yard
of each boarding-house a knot of broad-shouldered,
big-faced men about a keg of liquid comfort.</p>

<p>It is at celebrations that the worst excesses
show themselves. What with caring for their
large families and their boarders, the women usually
lose their attractiveness early, and therewith
their power to exercise a refining influence upon
their men-folk. A wedding or a christening-feast
lasts an entire day, and toward the end men
beastly drunk bellow and fight in the presence of
the terrified women and children. During festivals,
too, old feuds, rekindled by drink, flare up in
brutal and bloody rows. At such times one realizes
that the poet Kollár's famous phrase "the
dove-blood of the Slav" does not apply to the exhilarated.</p>

<p>Still, their heavy drinking is spasmodic, and
they are said to lose less time from work on account
of intoxication than certain other nationalities.
Says a Jersey City doctor practising among
the Ruthenians, "They drink, but few die drunkards
or hurt their health with alcohol. If a man
does get drunk he is likely to be violent. If he
strikes his wife she defends herself if she can,
but she does not complain, for she knows he has
'a right to hit her' and that makes a great difference."
In Slavic neighborhoods, American influence
first shows itself in the rise of a community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
sentiment against alcoholic excess and in a growing
refinement in festal customs.</p>


<h4>CRIMES OF THE PRIMITIVE PASSIONS</h4>

<p>For crime the Slav betrays no such bent as the
South Italian. Aside from petty thieving&mdash;noted
in some cases&mdash;the complaints of people near a
Slav settlement center upon the affrays that follow
in the wake of convivial drinking. The Bohemians
have about the same criminal tendencies
as the Germans. The other Slavs reveal the propensities
of a rude, undeveloped people of undisciplined
primitive passions. Animosity rather
than cupidity is the motive of crime. When the
Slav seeks illicit gain he takes the direct path of
violence rather than the devious path of chicane;
he commits robbery or burglary rather than theft
or fraud or extortion. From crimes against
chastity, and the loathsome knaveries that center
in the social evil, he is singularly free. Morally,
the stock is better than one would judge from the
police records and from its reputation. No doubt
if the descendants of these immigrants have the
proper training and surrounding they will prove
as orderly as the old American stock.</p>


<h4>SLAVIC BRUTALITY AND RECKLESS FECUNDITY</h4>

<p>Among the South Slavs "every married man,"
says Vrčević, as quoted by Professor W. I.
Thomas, "strikes his wife black and blue at least
once a month, or spreads a box on the ear over her
whole face, or else people are likely to say that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
is afraid of his wife." Their popular proverbs
corroborate this, as for example: "He who does
not beat his wife is no man." "Strike a wife and
a snake on the head." "One devil is afraid of the
cross, the other (the wife) of a stick." "The dog
may howl, but the wife must hold her tongue."
In one wedding-song the bride begs her husband:
"Strike your wife only with good cause and when
she has greatly vexed you." In another folk-song
the young wife sings: "What sort of husband
are you to me? You do not pull my hair, nor do
you strike me!"</p>

<p>Although beating the wife with a wet rope is
going out of practice, the Galician peasant, says
Von Hupka, "still regards her as a thing belonging
to him, which was made in the first place for
his service." No wonder the Slav mother averages
eight children! No wonder there is an appalling
infant mortality, while a childbed death is
too often the fate of the forspent mother. Little
cares the stolid peasant. What is the woman
there for? Nor is this view strange in the New
World. In Hungary the Slovak women "bear a
child a year&mdash;'always either bearing or nursing,'
is the saying." But the annual child arrives likewise
in the Slovak families of New York. The
Slav wife in this country bears from two to two
and a half times as fast as the wife of American
parentage. Her daughter born under the Stars
and Stripes is seven-eighths as prolific as her barefoot
immigrant mother. The average Slavic charity
case involves five persons, the German or Scandinavian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a><br /><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a><br /><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
case four persons, the American case
three and one-half persons. A drunken Pole said
with pride to the agent of a charitable society that
was supporting his family: "Just think what
I've done for the State! I've given it ten children!"</p>

</div>

<p>The Middle Ages are beginning to show among
us. In twenty-one rural counties of Minnesota
the Polish women have borne, on an average, seven
children in the course of fourteen and a half years
of married life. The full tale, no doubt, will come
to nine or ten. Thanks to our child-pitying, child-saving
civilization, the Polish mother will keep her
brood nearly as well as her American neighbor
with four or five. "The Irish for children," runs
the proverb; and yet one Irish-American wife out
of thirteen is childless, and one English-American
wife out of twelve. But on the Minnesota farms
only one Polish-American wife out of fifty-eight
is barren!</p>

<p>In a county where the Poles, although but a
third of the population, register 58 per cent. of the
births, an old farmer said to me: "The Yankees
here are too lazy to have kids. The Poles have
from ten to fifteen in a family, and in a hundred
years the people here will all be Poles." A hundred
years? Even fourteen years ago Father
Kruszka reckoned that there were in this country
700 such Polish communities, averaging a hundred
families each. So there are hundreds of centers
from which the Middle Ages spread. Farm by
farm, township by township, the displacement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the American goes on&mdash;a quiet conquest, without
spear or trumpet, a conquest made by child-bearing
women. The fathers forage, but it is the
mothers who have to face anguish, exhaustion, and
even death in the campaign to possess the land.
Spending their women brutally, the Slavs advance;
pitying their women, the Americans retreat.</p>

<p>How can woman-worth go on rising as this country
fills with people who have the brood-mare idea
of woman? Yet leaders in the cause of womanhood
are doing their best to hold the door open for
the very tribes who most despise and misuse their
sex! On the other hand, the new immigration
may well find favor in the eyes of those who look
upon the bearing of ten children as woman's best
lot, and are complacent at seeing the stocks with
low standards outbreed and crowd into oblivion
the stocks with high standards.</p>


<h4>SLOW ASSIMILATION</h4>

<p>Eastern Europe is full of half-drowned nationalities,
which only of late are regaining self-consciousness.
Bohemians, Slovaks, Poles, Lithuanians,
Servians, and Bulgarians&mdash;each have had an
"awakening," in which language revival and the
study of national literature and history have
played a great part. The immigrants who come
with this quickened sense of nationality make it a
point of honor not to drift selfishly with the
American current and so lose touch with their
struggling brethren in the old home. After refusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to be Germanized, Russified, or Magyarized
in the old country, the patriotic Bohemian or Pole
is bound to resist absorption here. It was the
Irish-Americans who got the leverage for freeing
Ireland. Now the Bohemians here are hoping to
win home rule for Bohemia; while the Polish-Americans
expect to find on this side of the water
the fulcrum for the lever that shall free Poland.
What, then, more natural than to cling to their
own speech and traditions in home and church and
parish school?</p>

<p>The vernacular press, of course, harps ever on
the chord of "the national speech," so that the
second generation may not drift away to the reading
of American newspapers. The church, too,
which carries matters with a high hand among the
Poles, holds the immigrants away from Americanization.
The good priests fear lest some of their
flock should turn away from religion, while the
greedy priests dread lest the flock should become
restless under priestly dictation.</p>

<p>Our million Poles outnumber all the rest of the
Slavs in America, and the Poles are very clannish.
When they settle in groups there is little association
between them and their neighbors. "In the
communities visited," reports the Industrial Commission,
"farmers of German, Scandinavian,
Irish, Bohemian, Belgian, Swiss, and American
origin were found living in juxtaposition to Poles.
In virtually every instance the Pole was considered
one degree lower than his neighbors."
"Neither the Poles as a body nor the others desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to fuse socially, and the Bohemians felt well
above their Slavic brethren." The farmers look
down on the Poles as uncleanly, intemperate,
quarrelsome, ignorant, priest-ridden, and hard on
women and children. When a few Poles have
come into a neighborhood, the other farmers become
restless, sell out, and move away. Soon a
parish is organized, church and parish school
arise, the public school decays, and Slavdom has
a new outpost.</p>

<p>The core of the large settlement is likely to be a
rancid bit of the Old World. Clerical domination
to a degree not tolerated among other Roman
Catholics, a stately church overlooking mean
farm-houses, numerous church holidays, a tiny
public school, built wholly out of State grant, with
a sister in the garb of her order as schoolmistress,
a big parish school, using only Polish and teaching
chiefly the catechism, a high illiteracy and a dense
ignorance among lads born on American soil,
crimes of violence rather than crimes of cunning,
horror of water applied inside or outside, aversion
to fresh air, barefoot women at work in the
fields, with wretched housekeeping as the natural
result, saloons patronized by both sexes, the priest
frequently urging his flock to "have as many children
as God will give them," much loth motherhood,
early death from excessive child-bearing,
large families brought up by the third, fourth, or
fifth wife, harsh discipline of children, political
apathy, a controlled vote, and an open contempt
for Americans and their principles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Little better off are the Slavs clustered by themselves
in some "mining-patch" in the coal-fields
or in the industrial quarter of a metal town. The
general population does not associate with them,
and they have their own church, school, customs,
and festivals. The men pick up a little English,
the women none at all. It is really the children
that are the battle-ground of old and new. Let
them mingle freely with Young America, and no
pressure from their parents can make them remain
different from their playmates. They dread
the nickname of "Hun," "Hunkie," or "Bohunk"
as if it were poison, and nothing will induce them
to use their home tongue or take part in the organized
life of their nationality.</p>

<p>In the big rural settlement, however, the children
can be kept from outsiders, and the parents,
who want them to settle on the farm, usually have
their way. A few of the more restless dive off the
island into circumambient America. For a little
time the second generation appears progressive;
it dresses flashily and shows itself "sporty."
But after it marries it loses spirit, settles down,
and obeys priest and parent. Whether the system
can hold the third generation remains to be
seen.</p>

<p>Obviously, the bird-of-passage Slovak or Croat
who has left a wife at home, and who roughs it
with his compatriots in a "stag" boarding-house
in a dreary "black country," is a poor subject for
assimilation. His life is bounded by the "boarding
boss," the saloon-keeper, the private banker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and the priest&mdash;all of them of his own folk. Aside
from the foreman's cursing, American life
reaches him only through the eye, and then only
the worst side of it. But for the good pay, he
would hate his life here; and he goes back home
with little idea of America save that it is a land of
big chances to make money.</p>


<h4>SMALL ABILITY OF IMMIGRANT SLAVS</h4>

<p>Without calling in question the worth of the
Slavic race, one may note that the immigrant
Slavs have small reputation for capacity. Many
observers, after allowing for their illiteracy and
lack of opportunity, still insist that they have little
to contribute to our people. "These people
haven't any natural ability to transmit," said a
large employer of Slavs. "You may grind and
polish dull minds all you want to in the public
schools, but you never will get a keen edge on
them because the steel is poor." "They aren't
up to the American grade," insisted the manager
of a steel-works. "We have a 'suggestion box,'
and we reward valuable suggestions from our
men, but precious few ever come from immigrant
labor." The labor agent of a great implement-works
rates the immigrant 75 in ability as compared
with the American. A Bohemian leader
puts his people above the Americans in music and
the fine arts, but concedes the superiority of the
Americans in constructive imagination, organizing
ability, and tenacity of purpose. "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Czechs," he says, "are strong in resistance but
are not aggressive."</p>

<p>A steel-town superintendent of schools finds the
bulk of the children of the Slavs "rather sluggish
intellectually." They do well in the lower grades,
where memory counts most; but in the higher
grades, where association is called for, they fall
behind. Of 23,000 pupils of non-English-speaking
fathers, 43.4 per cent. were found to be behind
their grade; the percentage of retardation for the
children of Bohemian fathers was only 35.6 per
cent.; but for Poles, the retardation was 58.1 per
cent., and for Slovaks 54.5 per cent. While this
showing is poor, there are good school men who
stoutly maintain that it is still too soon to judge
what the Slav-American can do.</p>


<h4>THE ALARMING PROSPECT OF SLAVIC IMMIGRATION</h4>

<p>An outflow of political exiles comes to an end
when there is a turn of the political wheel; but a
stream squeezed out by population pressure may
flow on forever. So long as the birth-rate remains
high, the mother-country is not depleted by
the hemorrhage. "What has been the effect of
emigration to America upon conditions in Bohemia?"
I asked of an intelligent Czech. "Bohemia,"
he replied, with emphasis, "is just as
crowded to-day; the struggle is just as hard as if
never a Bohemian had left for America." "Will
Polish emigration remain large?" I asked a
leader of the Polish-Americans. "Yes," he replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
"it will continue for a long time. The Poles
multiply at an extreme rate, and there is no room
for them to expand in Poland."</p>

<p>Still, these minor currents may be lost in the
flood that is likely to roll in upon us, once the great
central Slavic mass of 80,000,000 "true Russians"
is tapped. "This," observes the Immigration
Commission, "affords a practically unlimited
source of immigration, and one which may reasonably
be expected to contribute largely to the movement
from Europe to the United States in the
future." "The economic conditions which in
large part impel the emigration of these races
(Russian Hebrews, Poles, Lithuanians and Finns)
prevail also among true Russians, and already
they are beginning to seek relief through emigration."</p>

<p>So the tide from Slavland may swell, and the
superfecund Slavs may push to the wall the Anglo-Americans,
the Irish-Americans, the Welsh-Americans,
the German-Americans, and the rest,
until the invasion of our labor market by hordes
of still cheaper West Asiatics shall cause the Slav,
too, to lose interest in America, even as the Briton,
the Hibernian, the Teuton, and the Scandinavian
have lost interest in America.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE EAST EUROPEAN HEBREWS</h3>


<p>In his defense of Flaccus, a Roman governor
who had "squeezed" his Jewish subjects,
Cicero lowers his voice when he comes to speak of
the Jews, for, as he explains to the judges, there
are persons who might excite against him this
numerous, clannish and powerful element. With
much greater reason might an American lower his
voice to-day in discussing two million Hebrew
immigrants united by a strong race consciousness
and already ably represented at every level of
wealth, power, and influence in the United States.</p>

<p>At the time of the Revolution there were perhaps
700 Jewish families in the colonies. In 1826
the number of Jews in the United States was estimated
at 6000; in 1840, at 15,000; in 1848, at
50,000. The immigration from Germany brought
great numbers, and at the outbreak of the Civil
War there were probably 150,000 Jews in this
country. In 1888, after the first wave from
Russia, they were estimated at 400,000. Since the
beginning of 1899, one and one-third millions of
Hebrews have settled in this country.</p>

<p>Easily one-fifth of the Hebrews in the world are
with us, and the freshet shows no signs of subsidence.
America is coming to be hailed as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
"promised land," and Zionist dreams are yielding
to the conviction that it will be much easier
for the keen-witted Russian Jews to prosper here
as a free component in a nation of a hundred
millions than to grub a living out of the baked
hillsides of Palestine. With Mr. Zangwill they
exult that: "America has ample room for all
the six millions of the Pale; any one of her fifty
states could absorb them. And next to being in
a country of their own, there could be no better
fate for them than to be together in a land of
civil and religious liberty, of whose Constitution
Christianity forms no part and where their collective
votes would practically guarantee them
against future persecution."</p>

<p>Hence the endeavor of the Jews to control the
immigration policy of the United States. Although
theirs is but a seventh of our net immigration,
they led the fight on the Immigration Commission's
bill. The power of the million Jews in
the metropolis lined up the Congressional delegation
from New York in solid opposition to the
literacy test. The systematic campaign in newspapers
and magazines to break down all arguments
for restriction and to calm nativist fears is
waged by and for one race. Hebrew money is behind
the National Liberal Immigration League
and its numerous publications. From the paper
before the commercial body or the scientific association
to the heavy treatise produced with the
aid of the Baron de Hirsch Fund, the literature
that proves the blessings of immigration to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
classes in America emanates from subtle Hebrew
brains. In order to admit their brethren from
the Pale the brightest of the Semites are keeping
our doors open to the dullest of the Aryans!</p>

<p>Migrating as families the Hebrews from eastern
Europe are pretty evenly divided between the
sexes. Their illiteracy is 26 per cent., about the
average. Artisans and professional men are
rather numerous among them. They come from
cities and settle in cities&mdash;half of them in New
York. Centuries of enforced Ghetto life seem to
have bred in them a herding instinct. No other
physiques can so well withstand the toxins of
urban congestion. Save the Italians, more Jews
will crowd upon a given space than any other
nationality. As they prosper they do not proportionately
enlarge their quarters. Of Boston tenement-house
Jews Dr. Bushee testifies: "Their
inborn love of money-making leads them to crowd
into the smallest quarters. Families having very
respectable bank accounts have been known to
occupy cellar rooms where damp and cold streaked
the walls." "There are actually streets in the
West End where, while Jews are moving in, negro
housewives are gathering up their skirts and
seeking a more spotless environment."</p>

<p>The first stream of Russo-Hebrew immigrants
started flowing in 1882 in consequence of the reactionary
policy of Alexander III. It contained
many students and members of scholarly families,
who stimulated intellectual activity among their
fellows here and were leaders in radical thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
These idealists established newspapers in the Jewish-German
Jargon and thus made Yiddish
(<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jüdisch</i>) a literary language. The second
stream reached us after 1890 and brought immigrants
who were not steeped in modern ideas but
held to Talmudic traditions and the learning of
the rabbis. The more recent flow taps lower social
strata and is prompted by economic motives.
These later arrivals lack both the idealism of the
first stream and the religious culture of the second.</p>

<p>Besides the Russian Jews we are receiving large
numbers from Galicia, Hungary, and Roumania.
The last are said to be of a high type, whereas
the Galician Jews are the lowest. It is these
whom Joseph Pennell, the illustrator, found to
be "people who, despite their poverty, never work
with their hands; whose town ... is but a hideous
nightmare of dirt, disease and poverty" and
its misery and ugliness "the outcome of their own
habits and way of life and not, as is usually supposed,
forced upon them by Christian persecutors."</p>


<h4>OCCUPATIONS</h4>

<p>The Hebrew immigrants rarely lay hand to basic
production. In tilling the soil, in food growing,
in extracting minerals, in building, construction
and transportation they have little part. Sometimes
they direct these operations, often they
finance them, but even in direst poverty they contrive
to avoid hard muscular labor. Under pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the Jew takes to the pack as the Italian to
the pick.</p>

<p>In the '80's numerous rural colonies of Hebrews
were planted, but, despite much help from outside,
all except the colonies near Vineland, New Jersey,
utterly failed. In New York and New England
there are more than a thousand Hebrew farmers,
but most of them speculate in real estate, keep
summer boarders, or depend on some side enterprise&mdash;peddling,
cattle trading or junk buying&mdash;for
a material part of their income. The Hebrew
farmers, said to number in all 6000, maintain a
federation and are provided with a farmers'
journal. New colonies are launched at brief intervals,
and Jewish city boys are being trained
for country life. Still, not over one Hebrew
family in a hundred is on the land and the rural
trend is but a trickle compared with the huge inflow.</p>

<p>Perhaps two-fifths of the Hebrew immigrants
gain their living from garment-making. Naturally
the greater part of the clothing and dry goods
trade, the country over, is in their hands. They
make eighty-five per cent. of the cigars and most
of the domestic cigarettes. They purchase all but
an insignificant part of the leaf tobacco from the
farmers and sell it to the manufacturers. They
are prominent in the retailing of spirits, and the
Jewish distiller is almost as typical as the German
brewer.</p>

<p>None can beat the Jew at a bargain, for through
all the intricacies of commerce he can scent his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
profit. The peddler, junk dealer, or pawn broker
is on the first rung of the ladder. The more capable
rise in a few years to be theatrical managers,
bankers or heads of department stores. Moreover
great numbers are clerks and salesmen and
thousands are municipal and building contractors.
Many of the second generation enter the civil
service and the professions. Already in several
of the largest municipalities and in the Federal
bureaus a large proportion of the positions are
held by keen-witted Jews. Twenty years ago under
the spoils system the Irish held most of the
city jobs in New York. Now under the test system
the Jews are driving them out. Among the school
teachers of the city Jewesses outnumber the
women of any other nationality. Owing to their
aversion to "blind-alley" occupations Jewish girls
shun housework and crowd into the factories, while
those who can get training become stenographers,
bookkeepers, accountants and private secretaries.
One-thirteenth of the students in our
seventy-seven leading universities and colleges
are of Hebrew parentage. The young Jews take
eagerly to medicine and it is said that from seven
hundred to nine hundred of the physicians in New
York are of their race. More noticeable is the influx
into dentistry and especially into pharmacy.
Their trend into the legal profession has been
pronounced, and of late there is a movement of
Jewish students into engineering, agriculture and
forestry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>


<h4>MORALS</h4>

<p>The Jewish immigrants cherish a pure, close-knit
family life and the position of the woman in
the home is one of dignity. More than any other
immigrants they are ready to assume the support
of distant needy relatives. They care for their
own poor, and the spirit of coöperation among
them is very noticeable. Their temper is sensitive
and humane; very rarely is a Jew charged
with any form of brutality. There is among
them a fine <i>élite</i> which responds to the appeal of
the ideal and is found in every kind of ameliorative
work.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, fair-minded observers agree that
certain bad qualities crop out all too often among
these eastern Europeans. A school principal remarks
that his Jewish pupils are more importunate
to get a mark changed than his other pupils.
A settlement warden who during the summer
entertains hundreds of nursing slum mothers at
a country "home" says: "The Jewish mothers
are always asking for <em>something extra</em> over the
regular kit we provide each guest for her stay."
"The last thing the son of Jacob wants," observes
an eminent sociologist, "is a square deal."
A veteran New York social worker cannot forgive
the Ghetto its littering and defiling of the
parks. "Look at Tompkins Square," he exclaimed
hotly, "and compare it with what it was
twenty-five years ago amid a German population!"
As for the caretakers of the parks their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
comment on this matter is unprintable. Genial
settlement residents, who never tire of praising
Italian or Greek, testify that no other immigrants
are so noisy, pushing and disdainful of the rights
of others as the Hebrews. That the worst exploiters
of these immigrants are sweaters, landlords,
employers and "white slavers" of their
own race no one gainsays.</p>

<p>The authorities complain that the East European
Hebrews feel no reverence for law as such
and are willing to break any ordinance they find
in their way. The fact that pleasure-loving Jewish
business men spare Jewesses but pursue Gentile
girls excites bitter comment. The insurance
companies scan a Jewish fire risk more closely
than any other. Credit men say the Jewish
merchant is often "slippery" and will "fail" in
order to get rid of his debts. For lying the immigrant
has a very bad reputation. In the North
End of Boston "the readiness of the Jews to
commit perjury has passed into a proverb."
Conscientious immigration officials become very
sore over the incessant fire of false accusations
to which they are subjected by the Jewish press
and societies. United States senators complain
that during the close of the struggle over the immigration
bill they were overwhelmed with a torrent
of crooked statistics and misrepresentations
by the Hebrews fighting the literacy test.</p>

<p>Graver yet is the charge that these East European
immigrants lower standards wherever they
enter. In the boot and shoe trade some Hebrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a><br /><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a><br /><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
jobbers who, after sending in an order to the manufacturer,
find the market taking an unexpected
downward turn, will reject a consignment on
some pretext in order to evade a loss. Says Dr.
Bushee: "The shame of a variety of underhanded
methods in trade not easily punishable by
law must be laid at the door of a certain type of
Jew." It is charged that for personal gain the
Jewish dealer wilfully disregards the customs of
the trade and thereby throws trade ethics into
confusion. Physicians and lawyers complain
that their Jewish colleagues tend to break down
the ethics of their professions. It is certain that
Jews have commercialized the social evil, commercialized
the theatre, and done much to commercialize
the newspaper.</p>

</div>

<p>The Jewish leaders admit much truth in the
impeachment. One accounts for the bad reputation
of his race in the legal profession by pointing
out that they entered the tricky branches of
it, viz., commercial law and criminal law. Says
a high minded lawyer: "If the average American
entered law as we have to, without money,
connections or adequate professional education,
he would be a shyster too." Another observes
that the sharp practice of the Russo-Jewish lawyer
belongs to the earlier part of his career when
he must succeed or starve. As he prospers his
sense of responsibility grows. For example,
some years ago the Bar Association of New York
opposed the promotion of a certain Hebrew lawyer
to the bench on the ground of his unprofessional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
practices. But this same lawyer made one
of the best judges the city ever had, and when he
retired he was banqueted by the Association.</p>

<p>The truth seems to be that the lower class of
Jews of eastern Europe reach here moral cripples,
their souls warped and dwarfed by iron
circumstance. The experience of Russian repression
has made them haters of government
and corrupters of the police. Life amid a bigoted
and hostile population has left them aloof
and thick-skinned. A tribal spirit intensified by
social isolation prompts them to rush to the rescue
of the caught rascal of their own race. Pent
within the Talmud and the Pale of Settlement,
their interests have become few, and many of
them have developed a monstrous and repulsive
love of gain. When now, they use their Old-World
shove and wile and lie in a society like
ours, as unprotected as a snail out of its shell,
they rapidly push up into a position of prosperous
parasitism, leaving scorn and curses in
their wake.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, it dawns upon this twisted
soul that here there is no need to be weazel or
hedgehog. He finds himself in a new game, the
rules of which are made by <em>all</em> the players. He
himself is a part of the state that is weakened by
his law-breaking, a member of the profession that
is degraded by his sharp practices. So smirk and
cringe and trick presently fall away from him,
and he stands erect. This is why, in the same
profession at the same time, those most active in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
breaking down standards are Jews and those
most active in raising standards are Jews&mdash;of an
earlier coming or a later generation. "On the
average," says a Jewish leader, "only the third
generation feels perfectly at home in American
society." This explains the frequent statement
that the Jews are "the limit"&mdash;among the worst
of the worst and among the best of the best.</p>


<h4>CRIME</h4>

<p>The Hebrew immigrants usually commit their
crimes for gain; and among gainful crimes they
lean to gambling, larceny, and the receiving of
stolen goods rather than to the more daring
crimes of robbery and burglary. The fewness of
the Hebrews in prison has been used to spread the
impression that they are uncommonly law-abiding.
The fact is it is harder to catch and convict
criminals of cunning than criminals of violence.
The chief of police of any large city will bear emphatic
testimony as to the trouble Hebrew law-breakers
cause him. Most alarming is the great
increase of criminality among Jewish young men
and the growth of prostitution among Jewish
girls. Says a Jewish ex-assistant attorney-general
of the United States in an address before the
B'nai B'rith: "Suddenly we find appearing in
the life of the large cities the scarlet woman of
Jewish birth." "In the women's night court of
New York City and on gilded Broadway the majority
of street walkers bear Jewish names."
"This sudden break in Jewish morality was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
natural. It was a product of cold, calculating,
mercenary methods, devised and handled by men
of Jewish birth." Says the president of the Conference
of American Rabbis: "The Jewish
world has been stirred from center to circumference
by the recent disclosures of the part Jews
have played in the pursuance of the white slave
traffic." On May 14, 1911, a Yiddish paper in
New York said, editorially:</p>

<p>"It is almost impossible to comprehend the indifference
with which the large New York Jewish
population hears and reads, day after day, about
the thefts and murders that are perpetrated every
day by Jewish gangs&mdash;real bands of robbers&mdash;and
no one raises a voice of protest, and no demand
is made for the protection of the reputation
of the Jews of America and for the life and property
of the Jewish citizens."</p>

<p>"A few years ago when Commissioner Bingham
came out with a statement about Jewish
thieves, the Jews raised a cry of protest that
reached the heavens. The main cry was that
Bingham exaggerated and overestimated the
number of Jewish criminals. But when we hear
of the murders, hold-ups and burglaries committed
in the Jewish section by Jewish criminals,
we must, with heartache, justify Mr. Bingham."</p>

<p>Two weeks later the same paper said: "How
much more will Jewish hearts bleed when the
English press comes out with descriptions of
gambling houses packed with Jewish gamblers,
of the blind cigar stores where Jewish thieves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and murderers are reared, of the gangs that work
systematically and fasten like vampires upon the
peaceable Jewish population, and of all the other
nests of theft, robbery, murder, and lawlessness
that have multiplied in our midst."</p>

<p>This startling growth reflects the moral crisis
through which many immigrants are passing.
Enveloped in the husks of medievalism, the religion
of many a Jew perishes in the American
environment. The immigrant who loses his religion
is worse than the religionless American
because his early standards are dropped along
with his faith. With his clear brain sharpened
in the American school, the egoistic, conscienceless
young Jew constitutes a menace. As a Jewish
labor leader said to me, "the non-morality of
the young Jewish business men is fearful. Socialism
inspires an ethics in the heart of the Jewish
workingman, but there are many without
either the old religion or the new. I am aghast
at the consciencelessness of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Luft-proletariat</i>
without feeling for place, community or nationality."</p>


<h4>RACE TRAITS</h4>

<p>If the Hebrews are a race certainly one of their
traits is <em>intellectuality</em>. In Boston the milk station
nurse gets far more result from her explanations
to Jewish mothers than from her talks to
Irish or Italian mothers. The Jewish parent,
however grasping, rarely exploits his children,
for he appreciates how schooling will add to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
earning capacity. The young Jews have the
foresight to avoid "blind alley" occupations.
Between the years of fourteen and seventeen the
Irish and Italian boys earn more than the Jewish
lads; but after eighteen the Jewish boys will be
earning more, for they have selected occupations
in which you can work up. The Jew is the easiest
man to sell life insurance to, for he catches the
idea sooner than any other immigrant. As
philanthropist he is the first to appreciate scientific
charity. As voter he is the first to repudiate
the political leader and rise to a broad outlook.
As exploited worker he is the first to find
his way to a theory of his hard lot, viz., capitalism.
As employer he is quick to respond to the
idea of "welfare work." The Jewish patrons of
the libraries welcome guidance in their reading
and they want always the best; in fiction, Dickens,
Tolstoi, Zola; in philosophy, Darwin, Spencer,
Haeckel. No other readers are so ready to tackle
the heavy-weights in economics and sociology.</p>

<p>From many school principals comes the observation
that their Jewish pupils are either very
bright or distinctly dull. Among the Russo-Jewish
children many fall behind but some distinguish
themselves in their studies. The proportion
of backward pupils is about the average for
school children of non-English-speaking parentage;
but the brilliant pupils indicate the presence
in Hebrew immigration of a gifted element which
scarcely shows itself in other streams of immigration.
Teachers report that their Jewish pupils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
"seem to have hungry minds." They "grasp information
as they do everything else, recognizing
it as the requisite for success." Says a principal:
"Their progress in studies is simply another
manifestation of the acquisitiveness of the
race." Another thinks their school successes
are won more by intense application than by
natural superiority, and judges his Irish pupils
would do still better if only they would work as
many hours.</p>

<p>The Jewish gift for mathematics and chess is
well known. They have great imagination, but it
is the "combinative" imagination rather than
the free poetic fancy of the Celt. They analyze
out the factors of a process and mentally put them
together in new ways. Their talent for anticipating
the course of the market, making fresh
combinations in business, diagnosing diseases,
and suggesting scientific hypotheses is not questioned.
On the other hand, an eminent savant
thinks the best Jewish minds are not strong in
generalization and deems them clever, acute and
industrious rather than able in the highest sense.
On the whole, the Russo-Jewish immigration is
richer in gray matter than any other recent
stream, and it may be richer than any large inflow
since the colonial era.</p>

<p>Perhaps <em>abstractness</em> is another trait of the
Jewish mind. To the Hebrew things present
themselves not softened by an atmosphere of
sentiment, but with the sharp outlines of that
desert landscape in which his ancestors wandered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
As farmer he is slovenly and does not
root in the soil like the German. As poet he
shows little feeling for nature. Unlike the German
artisan who becomes fond of what he creates,
the Jew does not love the concrete for its
own sake. What he cares for is the <em>value</em> in it.
Hence he is rarely a good artisan, and perhaps
the reason why he makes his craft a mere stepping-stone
to business is that he does not relish
his work. The Jew shines in literature, music
and acting&mdash;the arts of expression&mdash;but not often
is he an artist in the manipulation of materials.
In theology, law and diplomacy&mdash;which involve
the abstract&mdash;the Jewish mind has distinguished
itself more than in technology or the study of nature.</p>

<p>The Jew has <em>little feeling for the particular</em>.
He cares little for pets. He loves man rather
than men, and from Isaiah to Karl Marx he holds
the record in projects of social amelioration. The
Jew loves without romance and fights without
hatred. He is loyal to his purposes rather than
to persons. He finds general principles for whatever
he wants to do. As circumstances change
he will make up with his worst enemy or part
company with his closest ally. Hence his wonderful
adaptability. Flexible and rational the
Jewish mind cannot be bound by conventions.
The good will of a Southern gentleman takes set
forms such as courtesy and attentions, while the
kindly Jew is ready with any form of help that
may be needed. So the South looked askance at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a><br /><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a><br /><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the Jews as "no gentlemen." Nor have the Irish
with their strong personal loyalty or hostility
liked the Jews. On the other hand the Yankees
have for the Jews a cousinly feeling. Puritanism
was a kind of Hebraism and throve most in the
parts of England where, centuries before, the
Jews had been thickest. With his rationalism,
his shrewdness, his inquisitiveness and acquisitiveness,
the Yankee can meet the Jew on his own
ground.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Jewish Runner Soliciting Immigrants for the Steamship Company</p></div>
</div>

<p>Like all races that survive the sepsis of civilization,
the Hebrews show great <em>tenacity of purpose</em>.
Their constancy has worn out their persecutors
and won them the epithet of "stiff-necked."
In their religious ideas our Jewish
immigrants are so stubborn that the Protestant
churches despair of making proselytes among
them. The sky-rocket careers leading from the
peddler's pack to the banker's desk or the professor's
chair testify to rare singleness of purpose.
Whatever his goal&mdash;money, scholarship,
or recognition&mdash;the true Israelite never loses
sight of it, cannot be distracted, presses steadily
on, and in the end masters circumstance instead
of being dominated by it. As strikers the Jewish
wage earners will starve rather than yield. The
Jewish reader in the libraries sticks indomitably
to the course of reading he has entered on. No
other policy holder is so reliable as the Jew in
keeping up his premiums. The Jewish canvasser,
bill collector, insurance solicitor, or commercial
traveler takes no rebuff, returns brazenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
again and again, and will risk being kicked down
stairs rather than lose his man. During the Civil
War General Grant wrote to the war department
regarding the Jewish cotton traders who pressed
into the South with the northern armies: "I
have instructed the commanding officer to refuse
all permits to Jews to come South, and I have
frequently had them expelled from the department,
but they come in with their carpet sacks in
spite of all that can be done to prevent it." Charity
agents say that although their Hebrew cases
are few, they cost them more than other cases in
the end because of the unblushing persistence of
the applicant. Some chiefs of police will not tolerate
the Hebrew prostitute in their city because
they find it impossible to subject her to any regulations.</p>


<h4>THE RACE LINE</h4>

<p>In New York the line is drawn against the Jews
in hotels, resorts, clubs, and private schools, and
constantly this line hardens and extends. They
cry "Bigotry" but bigotry has little or nothing
to do with it. What is disliked in the Jews is not
their religion but certain ways and manners.
Moreover, the Gentile resents being obliged to
engage in a humiliating and undignified scramble
in order to keep his trade or his clients against
the Jewish invader. The line is not yet rigid, for
the genial editor of <cite>Vorwaerts</cite>, Mr. Abram Cahan,
tells me that he and his literary brethren
from the Pale have never encountered Anti-Semitism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
in the Americans they meet. Not the
socialist Jews but the vulgar upstart parvenus
are made to feel the discrimination.</p>

<p>This cruel prejudice&mdash;for all lump condemnations
are cruel&mdash;is no importation, no hang-over
from the past. It appears to spring out of contemporary
experience and is invading circle after
circle of broad-minded. People who give their
lives to befriending immigrants shake their heads
over the Galician Hebrews. It is astonishing
how much of the sympathy that twenty years ago
went out to the fugitives from Russian massacres
has turned sour. Through fear of retaliation
little criticism gets into print; in the open the
Philo-semites have it all their way. The situation
is: Honey above, gall beneath. If the
Czar, by keeping up the pressure which has already
rid him of two million undesired subjects,
should succeed in driving the bulk of his six million
Jews to the United States, we shall see the
rise of a Jewish question here, perhaps riots and
anti-Jewish legislation. No doubt thirty or
forty thousand Hebrews from eastern Europe
might be absorbed by this country each year without
any marked growth of race prejudice; but
when they come in two or three or even four times
as fast, the lump outgrows the leaven, and there
will be trouble.</p>

<p>America is probably the strongest solvent Jewish
separatism has ever encountered. It is not
only that here the Jew finds himself a free man
and a citizen. That has occurred before, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
causing the Jew to merge into the general
population. It is that here more than anywhere
else in the world <em>the future is expected to be in
all respects better than the past</em>. No civilized
people ever so belittled the past in the face of the
future as we do. This is why tradition withers
and dies in our air; and the dogma that the Jews
are a "peculiar people" and must shun intermarriage
with the Gentiles is only a tradition. The
Jewish dietary laws are rapidly going. In New
York only one-fourth of the two hundred thousand
Jewish workmen keep their Sabbath and
only one-fifth of the Jews belong to the synagogue.
The neglect of the synagogue is as
marked as the falling away of non-Jews from the
church. Mixed marriages, although by no means
numerous in the centers, are on the increase, and
in 1909 the Central Conference of Jewish Rabbis
resolved that such marriages "are contrary to the
tradition of the Jewish religion and should therefore
be discouraged by the American Rabbinate."
Certainly every mixed marriage is, as one rabbi
puts it, "a nail in the coffin of Judaism," and free
mixing would in time end the Jews as a distinct
ethnic strain.</p>

<p>The "hard shell" leaders are urging the Jews
in America to cherish their distinctive traditions
and to refrain from mingling their blood with
Gentiles. But the liberal and radical leaders insist
that in this new, ultra-modern environment
nothing is gained by holding the Jews within the
wall of Orthodox Judaism. As a prominent Hebrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
labor leader said to me: "By blending
with the American the Jew will gain in physique,
and this with its attendant participation in normal
labor, sports, athletics, outdoor life, and the
like, will lessen the hyper-sensibility and the sensuality
of the Jew and make him less vain, unscrupulous
and pleasure-loving."</p>

<p>It is too soon yet to foretell whether or not this
vast and growing body of Jews from eastern Europe
is to melt and disappear in the American
population just as numbers of Portuguese, Dutch,
English, and French Jews in our early days became
blent with the rest of the people. In any
case the immigrant Jews are being assimilated
outwardly. The long coat, side curls, beard and
fringes, the "Wandering Jew" figure, the furtive
manner, the stoop, the hunted look, and the martyr
air disappear as if by magic after a brief
taste of American life. It would seem as if the
experience of Russia and America in assimilating
the Jews is happily illustrated by the old story of
the rivalry of the wind and the sun in trying to
strip the traveler of his cloak.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE LESSER IMMIGRANT GROUPS</h3>


<p>The immigration question is a live wire and
whoever handles it may look for tingling
surprises. One is a bit startled on realizing that
through the "Bravas" from the Cape Verde Islands
we are getting a new dash of black from the
Senegambian tar-brush. How few are aware
that a third of Sicily, from which so many immigrants
come, is chiefly Saracen in stock, so that
the heredity of the Bedouin tribes of Mohamet's
time is to be blent with the heredity of our pioneering
breed! Who reflects that, with Chinese
and Japanese, Finns and Magyars, Bulgars and
Turks, about a half a million more or less Mongolian
in blood have cast in their lot with us and
will leave their race stamp upon the American
people of the future?</p>


<h4>THE FINNS</h4>

<p>Our 130,000 immigrants from Finland should
be counted to the Finno-Tartar branch of the
Mongolian race, although since the dawn of history
the western Finns have intermingled with
the Swedes until their blondness and cast of countenance
bespeak the North European. Nevertheless,
here and there among the Finns one notices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
that inward and downward slant of the eyes which
proclaims the Asiatic.</p>

<p>Ever since the heavy paw of the Russian bear
descended on Finland, these people have been
seeping into the United States. They come for
liberty's sake, bring their families and expect to
remain. Lovers of wood and water, they keep to
the North and the Northwest and are willing to
tackle the roughest land in order to become independent.
As farmers they are thrifty but, if left
to themselves, not particularly skillful or progressive.
Among them survive Old-World ways, such
as reaping by handfuls with a sickle and hauling
hay from the field on a sleigh. With a sharp ax
in his hand the Finn turns artist and will hew out
a log house so beautiful as to put an American
pioneer to the blush. One of the first things he
builds is an air-tight bath-house in which he may
steam himself by dashing water on hot stones.</p>

<p>Practically all these immigrants are literate
and they are eager patrons of night schools. In
acquiring English they are rather slow. Their
native ability is good, but is not considered to be
equal to that of the Swedes. They are quiet and
law-abiding, but litigious. With his grim intensity
of character the Finn cannot bear to compromise
his wrongs, but insists on all he thinks is due
him. It is needless to add that a man with so
much iron in his blood is honest.</p>

<p>Like the drunken Magyar or Lithuanian the
"loaded" Finn is a terrible fellow. Liquor
seems to let loose in him fell and destructive impulses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
which had been held in the leash by moral
ideas. The immigrants realize their danger and
the total abstinence movement is very strong
amongst them. A rival current is Socialism for,
strange to say, thousands of Finns, since coming
to this country, have utterly lost faith in the existing
social order. The mining company praises
the "temperance" Finns but makes haste to get
rid of the Socialists, although they are earnest
people of a peaceable temper.</p>

<p>Such movements reveal a thinking mood.
Thanks to the long struggle with Russia, the Finnish
mind is awake and open to ideas. Our Finns
have a real thirst for education and, besides supporting
the best of public schools, they maintain
near Duluth a college of their own of 1,200 students.
In all their discussions the women take an
equal share with the men and, when the Northwest
adopts equal suffrage, the wives of the Finns
will be among the first to vote. The Finns are
prompt to acquire citizenship and they do not
abuse the ballot. They will not vote for a fellow
countryman unless he is the fittest candidate for
the office.</p>

<p>Their civic attitude is revealed by an incident
that occurred at the outbreak of the Spanish-American
war. A community of agricultural
Finns near Carlton, Minnesota, who had settled
there in the eighties, came together after the call
for volunteers and considered what they ought to
do. After deliberation they concluded that in
token of their gratitude for their good fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a><br /><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a><br /><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
under the stars and stripes they ought to send one
of their number to the war. So they picked out
as their representative a stalwart, comely farm
lad of twenty-three and he served through the Cuban
campaign as Finnish champion of American
institutions!</p>

</div>


<h4>THE MAGYARS</h4>

<p>In the school of Western civilization the Finns
and the Magyars sit nearer the front than any
other people of Mongol speech and blood. In
progressiveness the quarter of a million Magyars
in our midst are as American as any immigrants
we receive. A thousand years ago the Magyars,
invading from Asia, conquered the Slavs in Hungary
and settled down as a dominant race. Although
a minority in the land, they have remained
masters and rulers. Hence the Magyar immigrant,
however poverty-pinched, feels the constant
prick of the spur of race pride. His sense
of honor is high. He will not seek charity unless
he really needs it. In a Magyar quarter squalor
and degeneration are not to be seen. The grass
and flowers about the cottages, the clean yard and
the clean children proclaim the presence of a race
that cannot bear to be looked down on.</p>

<p>While the Magyars have been political and military
leaders in Hungary, the masses are familiar
with the struggle for existence. They are
exploited in many ways by the Jews, who in Hungary
have been treated more liberally than anywhere
else in Europe. It is not surprising, then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
that few immigrants land here with so little
money as the Magyars. Lacking the means to
acquire land, they are little known in agriculture.
They go straight into the industries and
four-fifths of them are to be found in the workplaces
of Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio and New
Jersey. They constitute a floating labor supply
shifting constantly back and forth between Fiume
and New York. In recent years four Magyars
have departed for every five that arrived.</p>

<p>Their illiteracy is 11.4 per cent., a better showing
than is made by any immigrants from eastern
or southern Europe, save their cousins the Finns.
They bring more industrial skill than the average
Slav and their earning power is greater than that
of most of the Slavic nationalities. They are loth
to remain renters and in their endeavor to acquire
a home they will assume burdens heavier than
they can carry. Their race pride plays into the
hands of the hurry-up American bosses with the
result that, more than other immigrants, the Magyars
injure themselves by overwork.</p>

<p>In the Magyar stream the men are nearly three
times as numerous as the women and two out of
five of the men have left wives in the old country.
This means boarding-house life, shocking congestion
and a rich harvest for saloon and bawdy
house. The Pittsburgh Magyar who earns $1.80
a day will spend ten cents of it for lodging, forty
cents for food, and thirty cents for beer. The
Magyars are a wine-drinking people and the immigrants
come from the farms and know nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
of the corrosion of cities. Being high-spirited,
however, they want to become American quickly,
with the result that often they acquire our vices
before they acquire our virtues. In the mill
towns they learn to guzzle beer, carouse and leave
their earnings with the caterers to appetite.</p>

<p>Their crime record is bad. No alien is more
dreaded by the police than a vengeful or drink-maddened
Magyar. The proportion of alien
Magyar prisoners who have been committed for
murder is 35.6 per cent., higher than of any other
nationality save the Russians. Their hot-headed
and quarrelsome disposition causes personal violence
to bulk very large in their crime. In offenses
against chastity their showing is bad, but
their bent for gainful crime is slight.</p>

<p>Most Magyars come to America with the expectation
of returning eventually to Hungary to
live. For this reason few have acquired citizenship
and scarcely any immigrants from southeastern
Europe show less interest in the ballot.
After a trip or two home and a vain effort to settle
down to life in the old country, many return to
America reconciled, to the prospect of ending their
days here.</p>


<h4>THE PORTUGUESE</h4>

<p>Mongrelism and social decay have hurt the
southwest of Europe even more than the Turk
has hurt the southeast. This is why the 60,000
Portuguese in the United States are, in point of
culture, behind even the Servians and the Macedonians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
In the growing army of foreign born
illiterates they constitute the van. Not even the
Turks, Syrians or East Indians can vie with them.
On arrival not a third are able to read and write.
As we find them in the cotton mills 55 per cent. of
them cannot speak English. Even after ten
years or more in our midst two Portuguese out
of five cannot manage the speech of the country.</p>

<p>There are two centers of Portuguese distribution&mdash;southeastern
New England and central California.
California has 23,000 Portuguese immigrants,
Massachusetts 26,000, Rhode Island 6,000.
In Boston are 1,225, in Cambridge 2,000, in Providence
2,200, in Lowell 2,200, in New Bedford
4,000, in Fall River 14,000. We understand why
Portuguese should settle in California but what
brings these olive-skinned people to chilly New
England? The answer takes us into the realm of
Chance. In the beginning of a stream of immigration
there is often romance. Then, if ever,
accident counts and the venturesome individual.
Just as a fallen tree on the Continental Divide
may turn certain snow waters from the Pacific to
the Gulf, so a practice of New Bedford whalers
a lifetime ago caused the crowded Azores to overflow
into Massachusetts instead of Brazil. In the
old days the whalers, after a summer cruise,
touched at the Azores and took on each from 25
to 35 natives. When after two or three years of
whaling they returned to New Bedford, some of
these Azoreans remained and a settlement grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a><br /><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a><br /><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
up. To-day their quarter of New Bedford,
known as "Fayal," is very prosperous.</p>

<p>All down Cape Cod these fishermen have well
nigh replaced the sea-faring Yankees. Provincetown,
the spot where the Pilgrims first landed and
which was settled by the purest English, seems
to-day a South European town. Handsome dark-skinned
Azoreans man the fishing boats, Correa,
Silva, Cabral, and Manta are the names on the
shops and the Roman Catholics outnumber those
of any other denomination.</p>

<p>When the bottom fell out of whaling the New
Bedford Portuguese went into the cotton mills
and their countrymen began coming in larger
numbers. Besides the "White Portuguese"
have come in multitudes of "Black Portuguese"
from the Cape Verde islands. Three thousand
of them work during the season in the cranberry
bogs of Massachusetts and all other pickers flee
before them. They are obviously negroid, lack
foresight and are so stupid they cannot follow a
straight line.</p>

<p>The real Portuguese immigrate in families and
show very little money on landing. At home 70
per cent. of them were farmers or farm laborers.
They know sea and soil but bring no industrial
skill. If they cannot farm or fish they become
day laborers, mill hands, dockers, teamsters,
draymen, stationary engineers or firemen. Many
of their women are in the needle trades.</p>

<p>In the mills the Portuguese do not shine. The
men earn $8.00 a week, while the rest of the foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
born average $12.00. Their sons and daughters
earn $9.50, whereas the second generation of
other immigrants average $14.00. They put wife
and daughters into the mill and stay out of labor
unions. In eight cases out of nine they sleep three
or more in a room. In Lowell, according to the
government investigator, "The standard of living
of the Portuguese, as judged by the number
of persons per apartment, room and sleeping
room, is much lower than that of any other race."</p>

<p>In Boston, "Among the Portuguese poverty is
greater and more hopeless than it is among the
Jews and Italians, although there are no Portuguese
in the almshouses. Few of the Portuguese
are really well to do while many are partially dependent
because the labor of the women, who are
often obliged to support the family, is too unremunerative
to ensure their independence. Portuguese
women who have shown their low moral
sense by rearing a family of fatherless children
exhibit their courage and industry by sewing
early and late to gain a meager living for their
little ones."</p>

<p>Although unskilled, ignorant and segregated,
the Portuguese commit very little crime. Nevertheless,
their moral standard is in some respects
exceedingly low. Says Dr. Bushee: "The idea
of family morality among them is almost primitive,
resembling that of the negroes of the South.
Not only are elopements made and repaid in kind
without involving further complications, but also
what anthropologists call 'sexual hospitality' is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
not unknown among the Portuguese." They
"are not free from drunkenness and thieving, but
these faults are more carefully concealed among
them and fewer arrests result than would be the
case with other nationalities. Many of the Portuguese
men are idle and thriftless, and some of
the women are suspected of having been public
women in the Azore Islands from which they
come."</p>

<p>In California the Portuguese live like the Italians,
but while the Italians coöperate in leasing
land, the Portuguese are so individualistic that
they seldom rent or own land in partnership.
This has handicapped them in agricultural competition
with the Italians and the Japanese.</p>

<p>Their interest in education is of the feeblest.
In the mill towns the percentage of Portuguese
children at home is much larger than that of the
English; although in this respect the showing of
the Fall River Poles is much worse. No other
mill people have so large a proportion of their
children in the primary grades. The retardation
of Portuguese school children is high. In California
their children are taken out of school
early and the few who go on are sent to "business
college" rather than to high school.</p>

<p>No immigrants care so little for citizenship as
the Portuguese. Of the men whose term of residence
entitles them to claim citizenship only 3.2
per cent. have become naturalized. At New Bedford
only one in twenty entitled to citizenship
has sought it; whereas, of the other foreign born,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
over half have taken steps to gain citizenship.
The Portuguese farmers of California, although
prosperous, care nothing for public affairs and
not half of them take a newspaper. They are interested
only in making money, saving, and buying
land.</p>

<p>Owing to their extreme clannishness assimilation
is slow. In the city they live in a quarter by
themselves; in the country they form a colony.
They have their church life apart and their societies
center about their church. Although the
thriving farmers are improving their housing
and standard of living, they are "inclined to be
clannish, partly because Americans do not care
for their society." The chief agents of assimilation
are the children. Having mingled with
other children in the public schools, the young
people are taken into fraternal orders and share
the social life of the community. Moreover, the
parents unconsciously raise their standard of living
through their efforts to gratify the wants inspired
in their children by contact with schoolmates
coming from better homes. If the second
generation are soon to be segregated in parochial
schools, as are the children of the Poles and the
French Canadians, this happy assimilation of the
Portuguese through their children will be
checked.</p>


<h4>THE GREEKS</h4>

<p>Practically all our 150,000 Greeks have joined
us in the course of a decade and a half. The immigrants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
are mostly young men and the proportion
of females is negligible. Fugitives from
oppression always bring their families; so that
this stream almost without women is the clearest
proof that the immigration from Hellas is purely
economic. The Hellenic Government is democratic
and popular, military service is slight and
there is no religious or political oppression.
What has happened is that the huge American
orb has swum within the ken of a little people
about as numerous as the population of New Jersey
and the larger mass is exerting its solar attraction.
The peasant living on greens boiled in
olive oil, who eats meat three times a year and
keeps without noticing it the 150 fasting days in
the Greek calendar, has sniffed the flesh pots of
America. Hence a wild-fire exodus which has
devastated whole villages and threatens to deplete
the labor force of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Says the emigrant when questioned as to his
motive: "It is hard to make a living here.
America is rich, I can make more money there.
It is the money." "Money" is the keynote of
Greek immigration. Flashy strangers have gone
about talking with the peasant in his furrow and
the shepherd on the hillside, exciting their
imagination as to the wonders of America
and smoothing out the difficulties in the way
of migrating. In the earlier days of the movement
one man made $50,000 a year from his
network of agencies selling tickets and advancing
passage money on a mortgage. The letter to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
home folks, written by the Greek who has found
footing in Lowell or Chicago and which is read
by or to every one in the village, has been seized
upon by money-lenders and they have lost no opportunity
to encourage both the writing and the
wide circulation of such epistles. The result is
that, in the words of Professor Fairchild the closest
student of this immigration, "The whole
Greek world may be said to be in a fever of emigration.
From the highlands and the lowlands
of the Morea, from Attica, Thessaly and Euboea,
from Macedonia, Asia Minor and the Islands, the
strong young men with one accord are severing
home ties, leaving behind wives and sweethearts
and thronging to the shores of America in search
of opportunity and fortune." "America is a
household word in almost every Greek family."
"Greek immigrants know to just what place in the
United States they are going and have a very
definite idea of what work they are going to do."</p>

<p>Although there are 10,000 Greek mill hands in
Lowell, there is a strong tendency for the Greeks
in America to take to certain lines of business,
such as candy-kitchens and confectionery stores,
ice-cream parlors, fruit carts, stands and stores,
florist shops and boot-blacking establishments.
This is due to the fact that this catering to the
minor wants of the public admits of being started
on the curb with little capital and no experience.
Once his foot is on the first rung, the saving and
commercial-minded Greek climbs. From curb to
stand, from stand to store, from little store to big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a><br /><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a><br /><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
store, to the chain of stores, and to branch stores
in other cities&mdash;such are the stages in his upward
path. As the Greeks prosper, they do not venture
out into untried lines, but scatter into the smaller
cities and towns in order to follow there the few
businesses in which they have become expert.</p>

</div>

<p>If the immigration from Hellas keeps up, in
twenty years the Greeks will own the candy trade
of the country, the soda fountains and perhaps the
fruit business. Born epicures and cooks the
Greeks are going into the catering of food. In
Atlanta they have 35 restaurants, in St. Louis 26,
in Pittsburgh 25, in Birmingham 12 hotels and 14
restaurants.</p>

<p>Although Greeks are very rarely farmers, we
hear of them as fruit raisers in California, miners
in Utah, laborers on the railroads and fishers on
both our coasts. In the cotton mills the Greeks
are on a level with the more backward nationalities.
They show little mechanical ability and
few have reached responsible posts. They are
sober and amenable to discipline, but some employers
find them too excitable and unsteady to
be good workers.</p>

<p>The ugliest thistle patch we owe to Old-World
seed is the serfdom of thousands of Greek boys in
the shoe-shining parlors that have sprung up
everywhere. In some parts of Greece the peasant
sets his children early to work in order that
their earnings may leave him free to loaf the livelong
day in a coffee-house. Upon them, too, he
saddles the burden of providing dowries for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
their sisters. Accordingly, in certain districts,
the poor send away their boys to the cities of
Greece and Turkey, where they are hired out to
peddlers, grocers and restaurant keepers, who
treat them badly and work them unconscionably
long hours. From such parents the Greek in
America has no difficulty in recruiting boys whom
he exploits under conditions that savor of slavery.</p>

<p>In thousands of Greek shoe-shining shops are
working bound boys who are miserably fed and
lodged by their masters, paid $3.00 or $4.00 a
week and required to turn over all tips. Often
the tips alone cover the boy's wages and keep, so
that his labor costs the master nothing. Seeing
that from each boy the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrone</i> makes from $100
to $200 a year, a chain of such establishments
yields him a princely income. No wonder the
negro bootblack and the Italian bootblack have
been forced to the wall.</p>

<p>The bound boys are on duty 15 or 16 hours a
day and work every day in the year. They get in
their eating and sleeping as best they can. They
know no recreation. Late at night, completely
exhausted, they drop with their clothes on into a
bed that must suffice for four or five. Boys who
have been in a city several years may learn nothing
of it save the shop, their living quarters and
the streets between. Since the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrone's</i> game is
to keep his boys dumb and blind, they are not allowed
to talk freely with Greek customers. The
moment a customer talks with a boy, "trusties"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
crowd round to listen. No truth can be gotten
from the boys, concerning their age, their work or
their pay. To avoid the arm of the truant officer,
no Greek bound boy confesses to less than seventeen
years. They are ignorant of the rights and
rewards of labor in this country and are told that,
if they leave their work, they will be arrested.
Even their letters home are read and censored.</p>

<p>The effects of this servitude on the boys are
shocking. They miss all schooling and years may
elapse before they get their eyes open. The study
of English is the first step towards emancipation;
but where work is constant they miss even this
chance and young men will be found who have
been shining shoes for years and feel no ambition
for anything else. The physical ravages of such
work and confinement are appalling. In their
memorial to the Immigration Commission the
Greek physicians of Chicago say:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Young immigrants laboring in shoeshining places
for a period of upwards of two years become afflicted
with chronic gastritis and hepatitis. These diseases undermine
their constitutions, so that if they continue
longer at the same work they become afflicted with pulmonary
tuberculosis. Being too ignorant to take precautionary
measures, the disease is communicated to
others by contagion."</p></blockquote>

<p>They go on to ask the Government not to allow
such bound boys to land.</p>

<p>Through this peep hole we glimpse one secret
of the immigrant's sky-rocket commercial rise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Behold Stephanos, who landed ten years ago without
a drachma and now draws a cool thousand a
month from his business and is one of our solid
men! "Wonderful!" exclaims the innocent
American. "What stuff there must be in him!
Shows, too, that the country is still full of good
chances." The fact is the worthy Stephanos lolls
on the backs of a hundred unseen bootblacks who
are being ruined that he may prosper. When one
considers how mercilessly the immigrant landlord,
banker, saloon keeper, contractor or employment
agent hoodwinks and fleeces his helpless fellow
countrymen, certain of the "successes" one
hears of do not seem so remarkable after all.</p>


<h4>THE LEVANTINES</h4>

<p>One hundred thousand immigrants from Asiatic
Turkey introduce us to certain very marked differences
between the European civilization and
the Asiatic. In general, these Syrians, Armenians,
Arabs and Turks eschew alcohol, shun violence
and give little trouble to the police. They
are thrifty, acquisitive and self supporting.
Their women folk are hedged and virtuous. Their
native intelligence is beyond question, they respect
learning and they appreciate educational opportunities
for their children.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they tend to crowd, their
standards of cleanliness are low and they are
greatly afflicted with <em>trachoma</em>, an excludable eye
disease. Their narrow range of interests throws
out in ugly relief their lust of gain, especially gain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a><br /><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a><br /><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
without sweat. The Oriental attitude toward females
shows itself in a great difference between
the sexes in illiteracy, and in the betrothal of
young girls to mature men whom they scarcely
know. These people love trade, particularly the
individual bargain, which offers scope for what
is amiably called "a contest of wits" but is really
the ensnaring of the unsuspecting by the spider
type. At a time when our retail commerce has
happily come to the "one-price" system, the lustrous-eyed
peddlers from the Levant bring in
again the odious haggling trade with its deceit
and trickery.</p>

</div>

<p>That these immigrants lack physical and moral
courage is conceded even by their friends. They
do not settle their quarrels on the spot face to face
but revenge themselves treacherously from behind
when they get a safe chance. Their feeling
that truth is a luxury not to be brought out on
common occasions gives them an advantage in a
commercial system which takes for granted a good
deal of Anglo-Saxon straightforwardness. It
needs but half an eye to see that the "business
ability" attributed to the prospering dealer is
often nothing but the practice of Oriental craft
among the unsuspicious. As the Romans found
these people at the eastern end of the Mediterranean,
so we find them to-day, good looking, pliant,
clever, sometimes brilliant, but shifty and wanting
in character.</p>

<p>When two peoples find that their standards repel
like oil and water, they do not care to associate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Naturally, then, the Oriental immigrants
tend to huddle in colonies in which they may live
in the old way, keep their pride and spare themselves
the pains of adjustment to American ideals.
Not only do such colonies check the assimilation
of those who most need it, but they are apt to be
nests of congestion, disease and depravity, as well
as hot-beds for the propagation of false and impractical
ideas of political and social freedom.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF IMMIGRATION</h3>


<p>More and more immigration is an economic
matter, a flow of men rather than of families,
seeking gain rather than religious and political
liberty. Those who bring anything but
their hands are a very small and diminishing contingent.
Most of the money the immigrant shows
on landing has been supplied him for that purpose.
In 1882, when the old immigration reached its
height, the public domain was being carved up at
a tremendous rate, and the home-seeker predominated.
When the crest of the new immigration
arrived, in 1907, a quarter of a century later, free
land was gone forever, and the job-seeker predominated.
Formerly the idea of wandering oversea
sprang up naturally among the intelligent and
restless; now the idea is sown broadcast by thousands
of steamship agents and their runners. In
the tavern, knee to knee with the yokels, sits the
runner, and paints an El Dorado. The poor fellows
will believe him if he tells them the trees of
America bear golden leaves. When the "American
fever" seizes upon the peasant, it is the
obliging runner who suggests mortgaging his home
for the passage-money or who finds a buyer for his
cows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Common laborers who have been in America
are hired to go about among the peasants, flash
money, clink glasses, and tell of the wonderful
wages awaiting them. The decoy thus gets together
a group who elect him leader and pay him
so much per head to guide them to America. Little
do the poor sheep suspect that their bell-wether
is paid by the steamship agent for forming the
group and by the employer to whom he delivers
them. A forwarding business exists for sending
penniless laborers to America as if they were commercial
ware. Each leaves at home some relative
under bonds that the laborer will within a year pay
a certain sum as cost and profit of bringing him
here, Parties, through-billed from their native
village by a professional money-lender, are met
at the right points by his confederates, coached in
three lessons on what answers to make at Ellis
Island, and delivered finally to the Pittsburgh
"boarding-boss," or the Chicago saloon-keeper,
who is recruiting labor on commission for a steel
mill or a construction gang.</p>

<p>The emigration of 5,000 Rumanian Jews between
January and August, 1900, was brought
about by steamship agents, who created great excitement
in Rumania by distributing glowing circulars
about America. One authority stated to
the Immigration Commission that two of the leading
steamship lines had five or six thousand ticket-agents
in Galicia alone, and that there was "a
great hunt for emigrants" there. Selling steerage
tickets to America is the chief occupation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
large numbers of persons in Austria-Hungary,
Greece and Russia, the main sources of undesirable
aliens. In 1908 and 1909 the inflow and outflow
of steerage-passengers through our ports
amounted to about a million and a half a year.
Allowing an average outlay of $50 a head, we have
a movement furnishing $75,000,000 of annual business
to the foreign railway and steamship companies.
That a monster of this size grows dragon
claws with which to defend itself goes without saying.</p>


<h4>CHEAP LABOR A RAIN OF MANNA</h4>

<p>Still, it is not as cargo that the immigrant yields
his biggest dividends. But for him we could not
have laid low so many forests, dug up so much
mineral, set going so many factories, or built up
such an export trade as we have. In most of the
basic industries the new immigrants constitute at
least half the labor force. Although millions have
come in, there is no sign of supersaturation, no
progressive growth of lack of employment.
Somehow new mines have been opened and new
mills started fast enough to swallow them up.
Virtually all of them are at work and, what is
more, at work in an efficient system under intelligent
direction. Ivan produces much more than
he did at home, consumes more, and, above all,
makes more profit for his employer than the
American he displaces. Thanks to him, we have
bigger outputs, tonnages, trade-balances, fortunes,
tips, and alimonies; also bigger slums, red-light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
districts, breweries, hospitals, and death-rates.</p>

<p>To the employer of unskilled labor this flow of
aliens, many of them used to dirt floors, a vegetable
diet, and child labor, and ignorant of underclothing,
newspapers, and trade unions, is like a
rain of manna. For, as regards foreign competitors,
his own position is a Gibraltar. When the
European sends his capital hither, he puts it into
railroad securities yielding from four to seven per
cent., thereby releasing American capital for investment
in the enterprises that pay from ten to
thirty per cent. The foreign capitalist dares not
put up mill or refinery here, because he cannot
well run such concerns at long range. He may not
invade the American market with the products of
his mill over there, because our tariff has been
designed to prevent just that thing.</p>


<h4>ENDLESS INFLOW OF THE NEEDIEST</h4>

<p>Thus, so long as he stays in his home market,
the American mill-owner is shielded from foreign
competition, while the common labor he requires
is cheapened for him by the endless inflow of the
neediest meekest laborers to be found within the
white race. If in time they become ambitious and
demanding, there are plenty of "greenies" he
can use to teach them a lesson. The "Hunkies"
pay their "bit" to the foreman for the job, are
driven through the twelve-hour day, and in time
are scrapped with as little concern as one throws
away a thread-worn bolt. One steel-mill superintendent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a><br /><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a><br /><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
received official notice to hire no man over
thirty-five and keep no man over forty-five. A
plate-mill which had experienced no technical improvement
in ten years doubled its production per
man by driving the workers. No wonder, then,
that in the forty years the American capitalist has
had Aladdin's lamp to rub, his profits from mill
and steel works, from packing-house and glass
factory, have created a sensational "prosperity,"
of which a constantly diminishing part leaks
down to the wage-earners. Nevertheless, the system
which allows the manufacturer to buy at a
semi-European wage much of the labor that he
converts into goods to sell at an American price
has been maintained as "the protection of American
labor"!</p>

<h4>THE NEW IMMIGRATION AND THE HIGH COST OF LIVING</h4>

<p>Between 1900 and 1910, although population
grew twenty-one per cent., the output of the ten
principal crops of the country increased only nine
per cent. Between 1899 and 1911 the value of the
average acre's output of such crops increased
seventy per cent., while its power to purchase the
things the farmer buys was greater by forty-two
per cent. There has been a general upheaval of
prices, to be sure, but the price of farm produce
has risen much faster and farther than the price
of other commodities. This is "the high cost of
living," and it is immigration that has made this
imp shoot up faster in the United States than anywhere
else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>As long as good land lasted, our Government
stimulated agriculture by presenting a quarter-section
to whoever would undertake to farm wild
land. This bounty overdid farming, until, in the
middle of the nineties, the cost of living had
reached a minimum. With the ending of free
land, the upward turn was bound to come, but the
change was made more dramatic by the inpouring
of ten millions of immigrants without the knowledge,
the means, or the inclination to engage in
farming. Among us there is one American white
farmer for fourteen American whites, one Scandinavian
farmer for eight Scandinavians, one German
farmer for eleven Germans, one Irish farmer
for forty Irish; but it takes 130 Poles, Hungarians,
or Italians in this country to furnish one
farmer. Failing to contribute their due quota to
the production of food, these late-comers have
ruptured the equilibrium between field and mill,
and made the high cost of living a burning question.
Just as the homestead policy overstimulated
the growth of farms, the new immigration
has overstimulated the growth of factories.</p>


<h4>IMMIGRANTS AND AGRICULTURE</h4>

<p>Nevertheless, certain of the South Europeans
who are upon the soil have something to show
American farmers facing the problems of intensive
agriculture. Italians are teaching their
neighbors how to extract three crops a year from
a soil already nourishing orchard or vineyard.
The Portuguese raise vegetables in their walnut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
groves, grow currants between the rows of trees
in the orchard, and beans between the currant
rows. They know how to prevent the splitting
of their laden fruit-trees by inducing a living brace
to grow between opposite branches. The blackbeetle
problem they solve by planting tomato slips
inclosed in paper. From the slopes looking out
on the Adriatic the Dalmatian brings a horticultural
cunning which the American fruit-grower
should be eager to acquire.</p>

<p>The conversion of New Jersey barrens into
berry farms, vineyards, and pepper fields, the reclamation
of muck soil in western New York,
which Americans were not willing to touch, the
transmutation of wild Ozark lands into apples and
peaches, are Italian exploits which constitute
clear gain for the country. But there are other
immigrant farmers whose labors count on the
wrong side of the national ledger. Not a few Slav
colonies are clearing and tilling land so poor or
so steep that it ought never to have been brought
under the plow. The soil they have deforested
will presently wash into the rivers, leaving
stripped rocky slopes to grin, like a Death's-head,
in the landscape. The nation will have to pay for
it, just as France paid for the reckless ax work
that went on under the First Republic.</p>


<h4>HELPING THE IMMIGRANT TO GET UPON THE SOIL</h4>

<p>When confronted with the undeniable evils resulting
from the crowding of old-world peasants
into American slums and factories, the opponents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of restriction urge that the trouble is with the
distribution of the immigrants, there are not
really too many of them, but they are congested
in certain centers and industries. Then let the
state or the nation take the immigrant in hand
and settle him upon the soil, where there is room
for him and where he yearns to be. Supply him
with the best of information, guidance and supervision
and lend him a little money until he has
gotten upon his feet. Successful state colonization
would, no doubt, restore the balance between
agriculture and manufactures and prevent the
heartbreaking waste and misery resulting from
the present hap-hazard, catch-as-catch-can distribution
of immigrants among American opportunities.</p>

<p>Two other consequences ought, however, to be
evident; First, the policy would tend to use up
the agricultural opportunities Americans may prefer
to hold open for their children and grandchildren.
Second, State help to the immigrant would
furnish splendid advertising matter to the steamship
companies endeavoring to fill more steerages
and might soon swell the number of arrivals to
a million and a half or two millions a year. If we
wish to have more immigrants and to fill up this
country in the briefest possible time, state colonization
is just the way to go about it. On the
other hand, once the volume of immigration has
been brought under effective control, the policy
of aiding the immigrant to get upon the land is
heartily to be commended.</p>

<h4>INDUSTRIAL DISPLACEMENT</h4>

<p>The facts assembled by the Immigration Commission
shatter the rosy theory that foreign labor
is drawn into an industry only when native labor
is not to be had. The Slavs and Magyars were
introduced into Pennsylvania forty-odd years ago
by mine-operators looking for more tractable
miners. Agents were sent abroad to gather up
labor, and frequently foreigners were brought in
when a strike was on. The first instance seems to
have occurred in Drifton in 1870, and resulted in
the importation of two ship-loads of Hungarians.
The process of replacing the too-demanding American,
Welsh, and Irish miners with labor from
Austria-Hungary went on so rapidly that by the
middle of the nineties, the change was accomplished.
In 1904, during a strike in the coal-fields
near Birmingham, Alabama, many South Europeans
were brought in. In 1908 "the larger
companies imported a number of immigrants,"
so that the strike was broken and unionism destroyed
in that region. In 1880, in the first strike
in the coal-mines of Kansas, "the first immigrants
from Italy were brought into the fields as strike-breakers."</p>

<p>Poles were introduced into South Cleveland in
1882 to replace strikers in the wire-mills. The
meat-packing strike of 1904 in Chicago was broken
with trainloads of negroes, Italians and Greeks.
In 1883 the largest oil-refining company at Bayonne,
New Jersey, "in order to break the strike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
among the Irish and American coopers, ... introduced
great numbers of Slovaks, Ruthenians,
and Poles." In 1887 a coal-dockers' strike was
broken with Magyars, and in 1904 striking boiler-makers
were replaced by Poles. The striking
glass-workers in 1904 were beaten by the introduction
of Slovaks, Italians, Poles and Magyars.
During the 1907 strike in the iron-mines of northern
Minnesota, "one of the larger companies imported
large numbers of Montenegrins and other
Southeastern races as strike-breakers, while a few
of the smaller companies brought into the region
a number of German-Austrians." "One mining
company imported as many as 1300 of these strike-breakers."</p>

<p>The hejira of the English-speaking soft-coal
miners shows what must happen when low-standard
men undercut high-standard men. The miners
of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, finding
their unions wrecked and their lot growing
worse under the floods of men from southern and
eastern Europe, migrated in great numbers to the
Middle West and the Southwest. But of late the
coal-fields of the Middle West have been invaded
by multitudes of Italians, Croatians, Poles, and
Lithuanians, so that even here American and
Americanized miners have their backs to the wall.
As for the displaced trade-unionists who sought
asylum in the mines of Oklahoma and Kansas, the
pouring in of raw immigrants has weakened their
bargaining power, and many have gone on to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
a last stand in the mines of New Mexico and Colorado.</p>

<p>Each exodus left behind an inert element which
accepted the harder conditions that came in with
the immigrants, and a strong element that rose to
better posts in the mines or in other occupations.
As for the displaced, the Iliad of their woes has
never been sung&mdash;the loss of homes, the shattering
of hopes, the untimely setting to work of children,
the struggle for a new foothold, and the turning of
thousands of self-respecting men into day laborers,
odd-job men, down-and-out-ers, and "hoboes."</p>


<h4>IMMIGRANTS AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS</h4>

<p>The dramatic unionization of the garment industries
in our large cities has misled the public
as to the actual effect of recent immigration upon
trade-unions. The fact is that the immigrants
from the backward parts of Europe tend to
weaken, if not to shatter, labor organizations in
the fields they enter. They arrive needy and
eager to get any work at almost any pay. Having
had no industrial experience in the old country,
they lack the trade-union idea. Without our
speech, and often illiterate, they are very hard to
reach and to bring into line. So far as they are
transients, who are not staking their future on
the industry, they are loath to pay union dues and
to run the risk of having to strike. It is true that
the labor organizer evangelizes the alien workers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
with his union gospel; but by the time one batch
has been welded into a fighting force, another
batch is on his hands. His work, like Penelope's
web, is raveled out about as fast as it is woven.
No wonder that in the cotton industry unionism
has been wrecked, while, of the iron miners, less
than two per cent. belong to unions. In 1901 the
United States Steel Corporation's constituent
companies signed agreements with two-thirds of
their 125,000 workmen, among whom the English-speaking
held a dominant place. Ten years later
the company signed not a single agreement with
its beaten mass of Slav-Latins. There was no
union with which to sign. The organizing, organizable
Americans had been deleted from the
works. No wonder that organized labor demands
restriction of immigration. While the inrush continues,
the lines of labor will be weak, forming,
breaking, and reforming in the face of the intrenchments
of capital.</p>


<h4>IMMIGRANTS AND WAGES</h4>

<p>During the last fifteen years the flood of gold
has brought in a spring-tide of prices. Since 1896
the retail cost to Americans of their fifteen principal
articles of food has risen seventy per cent.
Wages should have risen in like degree if the
workman is to retain his old standard, to say nothing
of keeping his place in a social procession
which is continually mounting to higher economic
levels. We know that by 1907 wages had risen
twenty-eight per cent., while retail prices were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a><br /><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a><br /><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
rising twenty-six per cent. Evidently the working
man was falling behind in the social procession.
In the soft-coal field of Pennsylvania,
where the Slav dominates, the coal-worker receives
forty-two cents a day less than the coal-worker
in the mines of the Middle West and Southwest,
where he does not dominate. In meat-packing,
iron and steel, cotton manufacture, and other
foreignized industries the inertia of wages has
been very marked. The presence of the immigrant
has prevented a wage advance which otherwise
must have occurred.</p>

</div>

<p>What a college man saw in a copper-mine in the
Southwest gives in a nutshell the logic of low
wages.</p>

<p>The American miners, getting $2.75 a day, are
abruptly displaced without a strike by a trainload
of five hundred raw Italians brought in by
the company and put to work at from $1.50 to $2
a day. For the Americans there is nothing to do
but to "go down the road." At first the Italians
live on bread and beer, never wash, wear the same
filthy clothes night and day, and are despised.
After two or three years they want to live better,
wear decent clothes, and be respected. They ask
for more wages, the bosses bring in another trainload
from the steerage, and the partly Americanized
Italians follow the American miners "down
the road." No wonder that the estimate of government
experts as to the number of our floating
casual laborers ranges up to five millions!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>


<h4>IMMIGRANTS AND CONDITIONS OF WORK</h4>

<p>"The best we get in the mill now is greenhorns,"
said the superintendent of a tube mill. "When
they first come, they put their heart into it and
give a full day's work. But after a while they begin
to shirk and do as little as they dare." It is
during this early innocence that the immigrant accepts
conditions he ought to spurn. This same
mill had to break up the practice of selling jobs
by foremen. In one concern the boss who sold a
job would dismiss the man after a fortnight and
sell the job again, while another boss in the same
works would take on the dismissed man for a fee.
On the Great Northern Railroad the bosses
mulcted each Greek laborer a dollar a month for
"interpreter." The "bird of passage," who
comes here to get ahead rather than to live, not
only accepts, the seven-day week and the twelve-hour
day, but often demands them. Big earnings
blind him to the physiological cost of overwork.
It is the American or the half-Americanized foreigner
who rebels against the eighty-four-hour
schedule.</p>

<p>When capital plays lord of the manor, the Old
World furnishes the serfs. In some coal districts
of West Virginia the land, streets, paths, roads,
the miners' cabins, the store, the school, and the
church are all owned and controlled by the coal
company. The company pays the teacher, and no
priest or clergyman objectionable to it may remain
on its domain. One may not step off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
railroad's right of way, pass through the streets,
visit mine or cabin, without permission. There
is no place where miners meeting to discuss their
grievances may not be dispersed as trespassers.
Any miner who talks against his boss or complains
of conditions is promptly dismissed, and ejected
from the 35,000 acres of company land. Hired
sluggers, known as the "wrecking-gang," beat up
or even murder the organizer who tries to reach
the miners. No saloon, gambling-hall, or bawdy-house
is tolerated on company land. Even the
beer wagon may not deliver beer at houses to
which the superintendent objects.</p>

<p>It is needless to add that the miners are all
negroes or foreigners.</p>


<h4>IS THE FOREIGNER INDISPENSABLE?</h4>

<p>After an industry has been foreignized, the notion
becomes fixed in the minds of the bosses that
without the immigrants the industry would come
to a standstill.</p>

<p>"If is wasn't for the Slavs," say the superintendents
of the Mesaba Mines, "we couldn't get
out this ore at all, and Pittsburgh would be smokeless.
You can't get an American to work here unless
he runs a locomotive or a steam-shovel.
We've tried it; brought 'em in, carloads at a
time, and they left."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't they stay for three dollars a day?"
I suggested, "even if two dollars and ten cents
isn't enough?"</p>

<p>"No, it's not a matter of pay. Somehow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Americans nowadays aren't any good for hard
or dirty work."</p>

<p>Hard work! And I think of Americans I have
seen in that last asylum of the native born, the
Far West, slaving with ax and hook, hewing logs
for a cabin, ripping out boulders for a road, digging
irrigation-ditches, drilling the granite, or
timbering the drift&mdash;Americans shying at open-pit,
steam-shovel mining!</p>

<p>The secret is that with the insweep of the unintelligible
bunk-house foreigner there grows up
a driving and cursing of labor which no self-respecting
American will endure. Nor can he bear
to be despised as the foreigner is. It is not the
work or the pay that he minds, but the stigma.
This is why, when a labor force has come to be
mostly Slav, it will soon be all Slav. But if the
supply of raw Slavs were cut off, the standards
and status of the laborers would rise, and the
Americans would come into the industry.</p>

<p>Some bosses argue for a continuous supply of
green foreigners because the sons of the immigrants
are "above their fathers' jobs." A
strange industry this! Britain's iron industry is
manned by Britons, Germany's by Germans, but
we are to believe that America's iron industry is
an exotic which can attract neither native Americans
nor the sons of immigrants. The truth is
that the school and other civilizing agencies have
turned Michael's boy not against hard work, but
against the contempt with which his father's kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a><br /><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a><br /><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of work is tainted. But for the endless stream
of transients with their pigsty mode of life, their
brawls and their animal pleasures, the stigma on
the work would vanish, and the son of the immigrant
would be willing to inherit his father's job.</p>

<h4>IMMIGRANT WOMEN DOING MEN'S WORK</h4>

<p>While millions of women are being drawn from
the home into industry, the popular ideal of
womanhood serves as a precious safeguard, turning
them away from coarsening occupations which
might rob them of health or youth or refinement.
But this ideal, which is higher among the American
working-men than among the workers of any
other people, is menaced by the new immigrants,
with their peasant notions of womanhood. The
Slavs and the Italians are not in the least queasy
about putting their women into heavy and dirty
work, such as core-making, glass-grinding, and
hide-scraping, which self-respecting American
girls will not touch. The employer realizes this,
and continually tries these women in male occupations,
with the object of substituting them for
men, beating down men's wages or breaking a
men's strike. Engaging in such masculine work
not only prevents immigrant women from rising
to the American woman's sense of self-respect,
but it hinders their men from developing the
American man's spirit of chivalry. What is
more, the extension of woman's sphere on the
wrong side underlines the native standard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
womanliness, so that native girls are perhaps being
drawn into work that denies them refinement
and romance.</p>


<h4>WHAT BECOMES OF DISPLACED AMERICANS</h4>

<p>Does the man the immigrant displaces rise or
sink? The theory that the immigrant pushes him
up is not without some color of truth. In Cleveland
the American, German, and Bohemian iron-mill
workers displaced within the last fifteen years
seem to have been reabsorbed into other growing
industries. They are engineers and firemen,
bricklayers, carpenters, slaters, structural iron-workers,
steam-fitters, plumbers and printers.
Leaving pick and wheelbarrow to Italian and
Slav, the Irish are now meter-readers, wire-stringers,
conductors, motormen, porters, janitors,
caretakers, night-watchmen, and elevator-men.
I find no sign that either the displaced
workman or his sons have suffered
from the advent of Pole and Magyar. Some may
have migrated, but certainly those left have easier
work and better pay. It is as though the alien
tide had passed beneath them and lifted them up.
On the other hand, in Pittsburgh and vicinity the
new immigration has been like a flood sweeping
away the jobs, homes, and standards of great numbers,
and obliging them to save themselves by accepting
poorer occupations or fleeing to the West.
The cause of the difference is that Pittsburgh held
to the basic industries, while in Cleveland numerous
high-grade manufactures started up which absorbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the displaced workmen into the upper part
of their labor force.</p>


<h4>OUR STANDARD OF LIVING CRUMBLES</h4>

<p>Unless there is some such collateral growth of
skill-demanding industries, the new immigrants
bring disaster to many of the working-men they
undercut. The expansion of the industry will
create some good jobs, but not enough to reabsorb
the Americans displaced. Thus in the iron-ore-mines
of Minnesota, out of seventy-five men kept
busy by one steam-shovel, only thirteen get $2.50
a day or more, and $2.50 is the least that will maintain
a family on the American standard. It is
plain that the advent of sixty-two cheap immigrants
might displace sixty-two Americans or
Irish, while the setting up of an additional steam
shovel would create only thirteen decent-wage
jobs for them. Scarcely any industry can grow
fast enough to reabsorb into skilled or semi-skilled
positions the displaced workmen.</p>

<p>Employers observe a tendency for employment
to become more fluctuating and seasonal because
of access to an elastic supply of aliens, without
family or local attachments, ready to go anywhere
or do anything. In certain centers, immigrant
laborers form, as it were, visible living pools from
which the employer can dip as he needs. Why
should he smooth out his work evenly through the
year in order to keep a labor force composed of
family men with local roots when he can always
take on "ginnies" without trouble and drop them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
without compunction? Railroad shops are coming
to hire and to "fire" men as they need them
instead of relying on the experienced regular employees.
In a concern with 30,000 employees, the
rate of change is a hundred per cent. a year, and
is increasing! Labor leaders notice that employment
is becoming more fluctuating, there are fewer
steady jobs, and the proportion of men who are
justified in founding a home constantly diminishes.</p>


<h4>IMMIGRATION AND CRISES</h4>

<p>The fact that during an acute industrial depression
in this country the immigrant stream not
only runs low, but the departures may exceed the
arrivals (as in the eight months following the
1907 panic, when there was a decrease of 124,124
in our alien population), has been made the
foundation for the argument that surplus immigrant
labor, by promptly taking itself off when
times are bad here, relieves the labor market and
hastens the return to normal conditions. It is
overlooked that only the prosperous go, leaving
upon us the burden of the weak unemployed
aliens. Moreover, at the first sign of returning
prosperity, a freshet of immigrants starts up,
thereby checking sharply the good-times tendency
toward higher wages and better working conditions.</p>


<h4>THE RISE OF SOCIAL PRESSURE</h4>

<p>Free land, coupled with high individual efficiency,
has made this country a low-pressure area.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a><br /><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a><br /><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
It ought to remain such, because individualistic
democracy forbids a blind animal-like increase of
numbers. By causing the population to accommodate
itself to opportunities, our democracy
solves the Sphinx's riddle and opens a bright
prospect of continuous social progress. But of
late that prospect has been clouded. The streaming
in from the backward lands is sensibly converting
this country from a low-pressure area into a
high-pressure area. It is nearly a generation since
the stress, registered in the labor-market, caused
the British working-man to fight shy of America.
It is twenty years since it reached the point at
which the German working-man, already on the
up-grade at home, ceased to be drawn to America.
As the saturation of our labor-market by cheaper
and ever cheaper human beings raises the pressure-gage,
we fail to attract as of yore such peoples
as the North Italians and the Magyars.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="shepherds" id="shepherds"></a>
<img src="images/i224.jpg" width="600" height="418" alt="shepherds" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Roumanian Shepherds in Native Costume, Ellis Island</p></div>
</div>

<p>In 1898 few came to us from east of Hungary.
Now we are receiving them from Asiatic Turkey,
Circassia, Syria, and Arabia. An immigration
has started up from Persia, and conditions are
ripe for a heavy influx from western Asia. These
remote regions, which have had only twilight from
Europe's forenoon, are high-pressure areas.
Their peoples are too many in relation to the opportunities
they know how to use. Until education,
democratic ideas, and the elevation of women
restrict their increase, or machine industry widens
their opportunities, these regions will continue to
produce a surplus of people, which the enterprising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
avarice of steamship companies will make ever
more mobile and more threatening to the wage-earners
of an advanced country. Only lately
comes the announcement that one of the trans-Atlantic
lines is about to run its steamships through
the Dardanelles and Bosphorus into Black Sea
ports in order to bring immigrants direct to
America from southeastern Europe without the
expense of the long haul overland to Hamburg.</p>

<p>If an air-chamber be successively connected by
pipes with a large number of tanks of compressed
air, the pressure within the chamber must rise.
Similarly, if a low-pressure society be connected
by cheap steam-transportation with several high-pressure
societies, and allows them freely to discharge
into it their surplus population, the pressure
in that society must rise. But for Chinese
exclusion we should by this time have six or eight
million Celestials in the far West, and mud villages
and bamboo huts would fill the noble valleys
of California. Something like this must occur
as we go on draining away surplus people from
larger and larger areas of high-pressure.</p>

<p>Immigration raises the pressure-gage at once
for laborers, but only gradually for other classes.
It is the children of the immigrants who communicate
the pressure to all social levels. The investor,
landowner, or contractor profits by the
coming in of bare-handed men, and can well afford
to preach world-wide brotherhood. The professional
man, sitting secure above the arena of
struggle, can nobly rebuke narrowness and race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
hatred. Throughout our comfortable classes one
finds high-sounding humanitarianism and facile
lip-sympathy for immigrants coexisting with
heartless indifference to what depressive immigration
is doing and will do to American wage-earners
and their children. If the stream of immigration
included capitalists with funds, merchants
ready to invade all lines of business, lawyers, doctors,
engineers, and professors qualified to compete
immediately with our professional men, even
judges and officials able to lure votes away from
our own candidates for office, the pressure would
be felt all along the line, and there might be something
heroic in these groups standing for the equal
right of all races to American opportunities.
But since actually the brunt is borne by labor, it
is easy for the shielded to indulge in generous
views on the subject of immigration.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>SOCIAL EFFECTS OF IMMIGRATION</h3>


<p>There is a certain anthracite town of 26,000
inhabitants in which are writ large the
moral and social consequences of injecting 10,000
sixteenth-century people into a twentieth-century
community. By their presence the foreigners
necessarily lower the general plane of intelligence,
self-restraint, refinement, orderliness, and efficiency.
With them, of course, comes an increase
of drink and of the crimes from drink. The great
excess of men among them leads to sexual immorality
and the diffusion of private diseases. A
primitive midwifery is practised, and the ignorance
of the poor mothers fills the cemetery with
tiny graves. The women go about their homes
barefoot, and their rooms and clothing reek with
the odors of cooking and uncleanliness. The
standards of modesty are Elizabethan. The
miners bathe in the kitchen before the females and
children of the household, and women soon to become
mothers appear in public unconcerned. The
foreigners attend church regularly, but their noisy
amusements banish the quiet Sunday. The foreign
men, three-eighths of whom are illiterate,
pride themselves on their physical strength rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
than on their skill, and are willing to take jobs
requiring nothing but brawn.</p>

<p>Barriers of speech, education, and religious
faith split the people into unsympathetic, even
hostile camps. The worst element in the community
makes use of the ignorance and venality of
the foreign-born voters to exclude the better citizens
from any share in the control of local affairs.
In this babel no newspaper becomes strong enough
to mold and lead public opinion. On account of
the smallness of the English-reading public,&mdash;the
native born men number slightly over two
thousand and those of American parentage less
than a thousand&mdash;the single English daily has so
few subscribers that it cannot afford to offend
any of them by exposing municipal rottenness.
The chance to prey on the ignorant foreigner
tempts the cupidity and corrupts the ethics of
local business and professional men. The Slavic
thirst, multiplying saloons up to one for every
twenty-six families, is communicated to Americans,
and results in an increase of liquor crimes
among all classes. In like manner familiarity
with the immodesties of the foreigners coarsens
the native-born.</p>

<p>With the basest Americans and the lowest foreigners
united by thirst and greed, while the decent
Americans and the decent foreigners understand
one another too little for team-work, it is
not surprising that the municipal government is
poor and that the taxpayers are robbed. Only a
few of the main streets are paved; the rest are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
muddy and poorly guttered. Outside the central
portion of the city one meets with open sewage,
garbage, dung-heaps, and foul odors. Sidewalks
are lacking or in bad repair. The police force,
composed of four Lithuanians, two Poles, one German,
and one Irishman, is so inefficient that "pistol-toting"
after nightfall is common among all
classes. At times hold-ups have been so frequent
that it was not considered safe for a well-dressed
person to show himself in the foreign sections
after dark. In the words of a prominent local
criminal lawyer:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We have a police force that can't speak English.
Within the last few years there have been six unavenged
murders in this town. Why, if there were
anybody I wanted to get rid of, I'd entice him here,
shoot him down in the street, and then go around and
say good-by to the police.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here in a nutshell are presented the social effects
that naturally follow the introduction into
an advanced people of great numbers of backward
immigrants. One need not question the fundamental
worth of the immigrants or their possibilities
in order to argue that they must act as a
drag on the social progress of the nation that incorporates
them.</p>


<h4>ILLITERACY</h4>

<p>Among us there are now two million foreign-born
illiterates, while the number of foreign-born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
men of voting age unable to read and write has
passed the million mark. The confessed illiteracy
of the multitudes coming from southern and
eastern Europe is 35.8 per cent., as against 2.7
per cent. for the dwindling streams from the
North and West. We know that the actual state
is somewhat worse than these figures indicate,
because many unlettered aliens fearing rejection
falsely declare themselves able to read and write.
If the lands of ignorance continue to discharge
unhindered their surplus into our country, we
must resign ourselves to having numbers of fellow-citizens
who, in the words of the Commissioner
of Immigration at New York, "do not know the
days of the week, the months of the year, their
own ages, or the name of any country in Europe
outside their own." Or, as another official puts
it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In our daily official duties we come to know as belonging
to a normal human adult type the individual
who cannot count to twenty every time correctly; who
can tell the sum of two and two, but not of nine and six;
name the days of the week, but not the months of the
year; who knows that he has arrived at New York or
Boston, as the case may be, but does not know the route
he followed from his home or how long it took to reach
here; who says he is destined to America, but has to
rely on showing a written address for further particulars;
who swears he paid his own passage, but is unable
to tell what it cost, and at the same time shows an
order for railroad transportation to destination prepaid
in this country.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>While sister countries are fast nearing the goal
of complete adult literacy, deteriorating immigration
makes it very hard to lift the plane of popular
intelligence in the United States. The foreign-born
between twenty and thirty-four years of age,
late-comers of course, show five times the illiteracy
of native whites of the same age. But those
above forty-five years of age, mostly earlier immigrants,
have scarcely twice the illiteracy of native
whites above forty-five. This shows how much
wider is the gulf between the Americans of to-day
and the new immigrants than that between the
Americans of a generation ago and the old immigrants.</p>

<p>Thanks to extraordinary educational efforts, the
illiteracy of native white voters dropped a third
during the last decade; that is, from 4.9 per cent.
to 3.5 per cent. But the illiteracy of the foreign-born
men rose to 12 per cent.; so that the proportion
of white men in this country unable to read
and write any language declined only 9 per cent.
when, but for the influx of illiterates, it would have
fallen 30 per cent.</p>

<p>In the despatches of August 16, 1912, is an account
of a gathering of ten thousand afflicted people
at a shrine at Carey, Ohio, reputed to possess
a miraculous healing virtue. Special trains
brought together multitudes of credulous, and at
least one "miracle" was reported. As this country
fills up with the densely ignorant, there will be
more of this sort of thing. The characteristic
features of the Middle Ages may be expected to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
appear among us to the degree that our population
comes to be composed of persons at the
medieval level of culture.</p>


<h4>YELLOW JOURNALISM</h4>

<p>In accounting for yellow journalism, no one
seems to have noticed that the saffron newspapers
are aimed at a sub-American mind groping its way
out of a fog. The scare-heads, red and green ink,
pictures, words of one syllable, gong effects, and
appeal to the primitive emotions, are apt to jar
upon the home-bred farmer or mechanic. "After
all," he reflects, "I am not a child." Since its
success in the great cities, this style of newspaper
has been tried everywhere; but it appears there
are soils in which the "yellows" will not thrive.
When a population is sixty per cent. American
stock, the editor who takes for granted some intelligence
in his readers outlasts the howling dervish.
But when the native stock falls below thirty
per cent. and the foreign element exceeds it, yellowness
tends to become endemic. False simplicity,
distortion, and crude emotionalism are
the resources of newspapers striving to reach and
interest undeveloped minds. But the arts that
win the immigrant deprave the taste of native
readers and lower the intelligence of the community.</p>


<h4>PEONAGE</h4>

<p>The friendless, exploitable alien by his presence
tends to corrupt our laws and practices respecting
labor. In 1908 the House of Representatives directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the Immigration Commission to report on
the treatment and conditions of work of immigrants
in certain Southern States "and other
States." The last phrase was introduced merely
to avoid the appearance of sectionalism, for no
congressman dreamed that peonage existed anywhere
save in the South. The investigation disclosed,
however, the startling fact that immigrant
peonage exists in every State but Oklahoma and
Connecticut. In the West the commission found
"many cases of involuntary servitude," but no
prosecutions. It was in the lumber-camps of
Maine that the commission found "the most complete
system of peonage in the country."</p>


<h4>CASTE SPIRIT</h4>

<p>The desire to cure certain ills has been slow to
develop among us because the victims are aliens
who, we imagine, don't mind it very much. On
learning that the low pay of the Italian navy forbids
meat, we recall that all Italians prefer macaroni,
anyhow. With downtrodden immigrants
we do not sympathize as we would with downtrodden
Americans. The foreign-born laborers
are "wops" and don't count; the others are
"white men." After a great mine disaster a
Pittsburgh newspaper posted the bulletin:
"Four hundred miners killed. Fifteen Americans."
Of late a great split has opened between
the American and Americanized working-men and
the foreigners, with their new sense of being exploited
and despised. The break shows itself sensationally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
in the bitter fight between the American
Federation of Labor and the Industrial Workers
of the World. The former denounces the red-flag
methods of the latter, ignores I. W. W. strikes,
and allows its members to become strike-breakers.
When the latter precipitates a strike in some industry
in which the Federationists are numerous,
we shall see an unprecedented warfare between
native and foreign groups of working-men. It
is significant of the coming cleavage that the
mother of the I. W. W., the Western Federation
of Miners, at once the most American and the most
radical of the great labor-unions, has disowned
the daughter organization since its leaders sought
to rally inflammable and irresponsible immigrants
with the fierce cry, "Sabotage. No Truce."</p>


<h4>THE POSITION OF WOMEN</h4>

<p>Perhaps the most sensitive index of moral advancement
is the position assigned to woman.
Never is there a genuine advance that does not
leave her more planet and less satellite. Until
recently nowhere else in the world did women enjoy
the freedom and encouragement they received
in America. It is folly, however, to suppose that
their lot will not be affected by the presence of
six millions from belated Europe and from Asia,
where consideration for the weaker sex is certainly
not greater than that of the English before
the Puritan Reformation.</p>

<p>With most of our Slavic nationalities, it is said,
the boy may strike his sister with impunity, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the girl who strikes her brother is likely to be chastised.
Few of the later immigrants think of giving
the daughter as good a chance as the son.
Among the American students in our colleges
there are three young men to one young woman.
For the native students of foreign fathers the
ratio is four to one, and for the foreign-born eight
to one.</p>

<p>The Italians keep their daughters close, and
marry them off very early. In the 1909
strike of the New York shirt-waist makers,
all the nationalities responded to the union
ideal save the Italian girls. More than that,
hundreds of them slipped into the strikers' jobs.
Mystified by the strange, stolid resistance of the
brown-eyed girls to all entreaties, the strike-leaders
visited their homes. There they found
that the Italian woman, instead of being a free
moral agent, is absolutely subject to the will of
her nearest male relative, and the man would not
take the wife, sister, or daughter out of the shop
unless he was well paid for it.</p>

<p>East European peasants are brutal in the assertion
of marital rights, so when the poor immigrant
woman, noticing the lot of the American
wife, comes to the point of rebelling against the
overlarge family, she runs the risk of rough treatment.
Some nationalities are almost Oriental in
the way they seclude their women. It is significant
that the Ruthenian, Polish, Portuguese,
South Italian, and Greek female employees who
have lived here from five to ten years are further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
behind their men-folk in speaking English than
the women from northern and western Europe.</p>

<p>That the woman's movement in America is to
meet with hard sledding cannot be doubted. The
yielding conservatism of our East has been buttressed
of late by the incorporation of millions
of immigrants bred in the coarse peasant
philosophy of sex. It may be long before women
win in the East the recognition they have won in
the more American parts of the country. Recently
the school board of New York, on motion of
Commissioner Abraham Stern, refused even to
allow discussion of a woman teacher's petition
for a year's leave of absence without pay in order
to have a baby. This moved "<cite>The Independent</cite>,"
which has been a Mark Tapley on the immigration
question, to remark: "The wave of recent
immigration has brought with it the Oriental conception
of woman's status. A man whose religion
requires him every morning to thank God
that he was not born a woman is likely to treat
women so that they will wish they had been born
men. We must not shut our eyes to the fact that
in the future the Christian conception of womanhood
is not to be maintained in this country without
a struggle."</p>


<h4>THE SOCIAL EVIL</h4>

<p>From a half to three-fifths of the immigration of
the period 1868-88 was male, but the new immigration
shows a male preponderance of about three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to one. Among those from Austria there are 155
males to 100 females. Among those from Hungary
the proportion is 161 to 100; from Italy, 191;
from Asiatic Turkey, 210; from European Turkey,
769; from the Balkan States, 1107; from Greece,
1192. A quarter of the Polish husbands in industry,
a third of the married Slovak and Italian
men, nearly half of the Magyars and Russians,
three-fifths of the Croatians, three-fourths of the
Greeks and Rumanians, and nine-tenths of the
Bulgarians, have left their wives in the old country!</p>

<p>Two million more immigrant men than immigrant
women! Can any one ask what this leads
to? In colonial times the consequences of split-family
immigration were so bad that Massachusetts
and Connecticut passed laws requiring
spouses to return to their mates in England unless
they were "come over to make way for their families."
We are broader-minded, and will interfere
with nothing that does not wound prosperity.
The testimony of foreign consuls and
leaders among the foreign-born leaves no doubt
that in some instances the woman cook of the
immigrant boarding-house is common to the inmates.</p>


<h4>HOUSING</h4>

<p>In the South Side of Pittsburgh there are streets
lined with the decent homes of German steel-workers.
A glance down the paved passage leading
to the rear of the house reveals absolute cleanliness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and four times out of five one glimpses a
tree, a flower garden, an arbor, or a mass of vines.
In Wood's Run, a few miles away, one finds the
Slavic laborers of the Pressed Steel Car Company
huddled in dilapidated rented dwellings so noisome
and repulsive that one must visit the lower
quarters of Canton to meet their like. One cause
of the difference is that the Slavs are largely transients,
who do nothing to house themselves because
they are saving in order to return to their
native village.</p>

<p>The fact that a growing proportion of our immigrants,
having left families behind them, form
no strong local attachments and have no desire to
build homes here is one reason why of late the
housing problem has become acute in American
industrial centers.</p>


<h4>OVERGROWTH OF CITIES</h4>

<p>Not least among the multiplying symptoms of
social ill health in this country is the undue growth
of cities. A million city-dwellers create ten times
the amount of "problem" presented by a million
on the farms. Now, as one traverses the gamut
that leads from farms to towns, from towns to
cities, and from little cities to big, the proportion
of American stock steadily diminishes while the
foreign stock increases its representation until
in the great cities it constitutes nearly three-fourths
of the population. In 1910 the percentage
distribution of our white population was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

</table></div>


<p>It is not that the immigrants love streets and
crowds. Two-thirds of them are farm bred, but
they are dropped down in cities, and they find it
easier to herd there with their fellows than to
make their way into the open country. Our cities
would be fewer and smaller had they fed on nothing
but country-bred Americans. The later alien
influx has rushed us into the thick of urban problems,
and these are gravest where Americans are
fewest. Congestion, misliving, segregation, corruption,
and confusion are seen in motley groups
like Pittsburgh, Jersey City, Paterson, and
Fall River rather than in native centers like
Indianapolis, Columbus, Nashville, and Los
Angeles.</p>


<h4>PAUPERISM</h4>

<p>Ten years ago two-fifths of the paupers in our
almshouses were foreign-born, but most of them
had come over in the old careless days when we
allowed European poorhouses to send us their inmates.
Now that our authorities turn back such
as appear likely to become a public charge, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a><br /><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a><br /><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
obvious pauper is not entering this country. We
know that virtually every Greek in America is self-supporting.
The Syrians are said to be singularly
independent. The Slavs and the Magyars
are sturdy in spirit, and the numerous indigent
Hebrews are for the most part cared for by their
own race.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="whites" id="whites"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Distribution of Foreign-Born Whites in the United States&mdash;1910</p></div>
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, dispensers of charity agree that
many South Italians are landing with the most
extravagant ideas of what is coming to them.
They apply at once for relief with the air, "Here
we are. Now what are you going to do for us?"
They even <em>insist</em> on relief as a right. At home
it had been noised about that in foolish America
baskets of food are actually sent in to the needy,
and some are coming over expressly to obtain such
largess. Probably none are so infected with
spiritual hookworm as the immigrants from Naples.
It will be recalled that when Garibaldi and
his thousand were fighting to break the Bourbon
tyranny in the South, the Neapolitans would hurrah
for them, but would not even care for the
wounded.</p>

<p>Says the Forty-seventh Annual Report of the
New York Juvenile Asylum:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is remarkable that recently arrived immigrants
who display small adaptability in American standards
are by no means slow in learning about this and other
institutions where they may safely leave their children
to be fed, clothed, and cared for at the public expense.
This is one of the inducements which led them to leave
their native land.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Charity experts are very pessimistic as to what
we shall see when those who come in their youth
have passed their prime and met the cumulative
effects of overwork, city life, drink, and vice.
Still darker are their forebodings for a second
generation, reared too often by ignorant, avaricious
rustics lodging in damp cellars, sleeping with
their windows shut, and living on the bad, cheap
food of cities. Of the Italians in Boston Dr.
Bushee writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They show the beginnings of a degenerate class, such
as has been fully developed among the Irish.... If
allowed to continue in unwholesome conditions, we may
be sure that the next generation will bring forth a large
crop of dependents, delinquents and defectives to fill
up our public institutions.</p></blockquote>

<p>Says a charity superintendent working in a huge
Polish quarter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is the second generation that will give us trouble.
The parents come with rugged peasant health, and many
of them keep their strength even in the slum. But their
children often start life weakened physically and mentally
by the conditions under which they were reared.
They have been raised in close, unsanitary quarters,
in overlarge families, by parents who drunk up or saved
too much, spent too little on the children, or worked them
too soon. Their sole salvation is the open country, and
they can't be pushed into the country. All of us are
aghast at the weak fiber of the second generation.
Every year I see the morass of helpless poverty getting
bigger. The evil harvest of past mistakes is ripening,
but it will take twenty years before we see the worst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of it. If immigration were cut off short to-day, the burden
from past neglect and exploitation would go on
increasing for years.</p></blockquote>


<h4>THE WAYWARD CHILD OF THE IMMIGRANT</h4>

<p>In 1908 nine-tenths of the 2600 complaints of
children going wrong made to the Juvenile Protective
Association of Chicago related to the children
of immigrants. It is said that four-fifths of
the youths brought before the Juvenile Court of
Chicago come from the homes of the foreign-born.
In Pittsburgh the proportion is at least
two-thirds. However startling these signs of
moral breakdown in the families of the new immigrants,
there is nothing mysterious about it. The
lower the state from which the alien comes, the
more of a grotesque he will appear in the shrewd
eyes of his partly Americanized children. "Obedience
to parents seems to be dying out among the
Jews," says a Boston charity visitor. "The
children feel it isn't necessary to obey a mother
who wears a shawl or a father who wears a full
beard." "Sometimes it is the young daughter
who rules the Jewish family," observes a Pittsburgh
settlement head, "because she alone knows
what is 'American.' But see how this results in
a great number of Jewish girls going astray.
Since the mother continues to shave her head and
wear a wig as she did in Poland, the daughter assumes
that mother is equally old-fogyish when she
insists that a nice girl doesn't paint her face or
run with boys in the evening."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Through their knowledge of our speech and
ways, the children have a great advantage in their
efforts to slip the parental leash. The bad boy
tells his father that whipping "doesn't go" in
this country. Reversing the natural order, the
child becomes the fount of knowledge, and the
parents hang on the lips of their precocious offspring.
If the policeman inquires about some
escapade or the truant officer gives warning, it is
the scamp himself who must interpret between
parent and officer. The immigrant is braced by
certain Old-World loyalties, but his child may
grow up loyal to nothing whatever, a rank egoist
and an incorrigible who will give us vast trouble
before we are done with him.</p>

<p>Still, the child is not always to blame. "Often
the homes are so crowded and dirty," says a probation
officer, "that no boy can go right. The
Slavs save so greedily that their children become
disgusted with the wretched home conditions and
sleep out." One hears of foreign-born with several
boarders sending their children out to beg or
to steal coal. In one city investigation showed
that only a third of the Italian children taken
from school on their fourteenth birthday were
needed as bread-winners. Their parents thought
only of the sixty cents a week. In another only
one-fourteenth of the Italian school children are
above the primary grades, and one-eleventh of
the Slavic, as against two-fifths of the American
school children in grammar grades or high school.
Miss Addams tells of a young man from the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a><br /><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a><br /><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of Italy who was mourning the death of his little
girl of twelve. In his grief he said quite simply:
"She was my oldest kid. In two years she would
have supported me, and now I shall have to work
five or six years longer until the next one can do
it." He expected to retire permanently at the
age of thirty-four.</p>

<h4>INSANITY AMONG THE FOREIGN-BORN</h4>

<p>Not only do the foreign-born appear to be more
subject to insanity than the native-born, but when
insane they are more likely to become a public
charge. Of the asylum population they appear
to constitute about a third. In New York during
the year ending September 30, 1911, 4218 patients
who were immigrants or of immigrant parents
were admitted to the insane hospitals of the State.
This is three-quarters of the melancholy intake
for that year. Only one out of nine of the first
admissions from New York City was of native
stock. The New York State Hospital Commission
declares that "the frequency of insanity in
our foreign population is 2.19 times greater than
in those of native birth." In New York City it
"is 2.48 times that of the native-born."</p>

<p>Excessive insanity is probably a part of the
price the foreign-born pay for the opportunities
of a strange and stimulating environment, with
greater strains than some of them are able to
bear. America calls forth powerful reactions in
these people. Here they feel themselves in the
grasp of giant forces they can neither withstand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
nor comprehend. The passions and the exertions,
the hopes and the fears, the exultations and
the despairs, America excites in the immigrant
are likely to be intenser than anything he would
have experienced in his natal village.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that every year New York
cares for 15,000 foreign-born insane at a cost of
$3,500,000 and that the State's sad harvest of demented
immigrants during the single year 1911
will cost about $8,000,000 before they die or are
discharged, there is some offset to be made to the
profits drawn from the immigrants by the transporting
companies, landlords, real-estate men,
employers, contractors, brewers, and liquor-dealers
of the State. Besides, there is the cost of the
paupers and the law-breakers of foreign origin.
All such burdens, however, since they fall upon
the public at large, do not detract from or qualify
that private or business-man's prosperity which
it is the office of the true modern statesman to
promote.</p>


<h4>IMMIGRATION AND THE SEPARATE SCHOOL</h4>

<p>In a polyglot mining town of Minnesota is a
superintendent who has made the public school a
bigger factor in Americanization than I have
found it anywhere else. The law gives him
the children until they are sixteen, and he holds
them all. His school buildings are civic and social
centers. Through the winter, in his high
school auditorium, which seats 1200 persons, he
gives a course of entertainment which is self-supporting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
although his "talent" for a single evening
will cost as much as $200. By means of the
400 foreigners in his night schools he has a grip
on the voters which his foes have learned to
dread. Under his lead the community has broken
the mine-boss collar and won real self-government.
The people trust him and bring him their
troubles. He has jurisdiction over everything
that can affect the children of the town, and his
conception is wide. Wielding both legal and
moral authority, he is, as it were, a corporation
president and a medieval bishop rolled into one.</p>

<p>This man sets no limit to the transforming
power of the public school. He insists that the
right sort of schooling will not only alter the expression,
but will even change the shape of the
skull and the bony formation of the face. In his
office is a beautiful tabouret made by a "wild
boy" within a year after he had been brought in
kicking and screaming. He scoffs at the fear of
a lack of patriotism in the foreign-born or their
children. He knows just how to create the sentiment.
He has flag drills and special programs,
and in the Fourth of July parade and the Decoration
day procession the schools have always a fine
float. He declares he can build human beings to
order, and will not worry about immigration so
long as the public school is given a chance at the
second generation.</p>

<p>But is the public school to have this chance?</p>

<p>Multitudes of the new immigrants adhere to
churches which do not believe in the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
schools. "Their pupils," observed a priest to
me, "are like wild children." Said a bishop:
"No branches can be safely taught divorced from
religion. We believe that geography, history,
and even language ought to be presented from our
point of view." Hence with great rapidity the
children of Roman Catholics are being drawn
apart into parochial schools. In Cleveland one-third
of the population is supposed to be Catholic,
and the 27,500 pupils in the parochial schools are
nearly one-third of all school children. In Chicago
there are 112,000 in the parish schools to
300,000 in the public schools. In New York the
proportion is about one-sixth. In twenty-eight
leading American cities the attendance of the parish
schools increased sixty per cent. between 1897
and 1910, as against an increase of from forty-five
to fifty per cent. in the attendance of the public
schools. The total number of children in the parochial
schools is about 1,400,000. Separate education
is a settled Catholic policy, and the bishops
say they expect to enroll finally the children
of all their people.</p>

<p>To bring this about, the public schools are denounced
from the pulpit as "Godless" and "immoral,"
their product as mannerless and disobedient.
"We think," says a Slovak leader, "that
the parochial school pupils are more pious, more
respectful toward parents and toward all persons
in authority." The Polish, Lithuanian, or
Slovak priest, less often the German or Bohemian,
says bluntly: "If you send your children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
to the public school, they will go to hell." Sometimes
the priest threatens to exclude from the
confessional parents who send their children to
the public school. An archbishop recently decreed
that parents who without permission send
their children to the public school after they have
made their first communion "commit a grievous
sin and cannot receive the sacraments of the
church." Within the immigrant groups there is
active opposition, but it appears to be futile. In
the soft-coal mining communities of Pennsylvania
9 per cent. of the children of native white parentage
attend the parochial schools, whereas 24 per
cent. of the Polish children and 48 per cent. of
the Slovak children are in these schools. In
a certain district in Chicago where the public-school
teachers had felt they could hold their own,
the foreign mothers came at last to take away
their children's school-books, weeping because
they were forced to transfer their children to the
parish school.</p>

<p>Now, the parish school tends to segregate the
children of the foreign-born. Parishes are
formed for groups of the same speech, so a parish
school will embrace children of only one nationality&mdash;German,
Polish, Bohemian, Lithuanian,
Croatian, Slovak, Magyar, Portuguese, or French
Canadian, as the case may be. Often priest and
teachers have been imported, and only the mother-tongue
is used. "English," says a school
superintendent, "comes to be taught as a purely
ornamental language, like French in the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
high school." Hence American-born children
are leaving school not only unable to read and
write English, but scarcely able to speak it. The
foreign-speech school, while it binds the young to
their parents, to their people, and to the old country,
cuts them off from America. Says a Chicago
Lithuanian leader: "There are 3000 of our children
in the parochial schools here. The teachers
are ignorant, illiterate spinsters from Lithuania
who have studied here two or three years. When
at fourteen the pupils quit school, they are no
more advanced than the public-school pupils of
ten. This is why 50,000 Lithuanians here have
only twenty children in the high school."</p>

<p>When, now, to the removal of the second generation
from the public school there is added, as is
often the case, the endeavor to keep them away
from the social center, the small park field-house,
the public playground, the social settlement, the
secular American press and welfare work in the
factories, it is plain that those optimists who imagine
that assimilation of the immigrant is proceeding
unhindered are living in a fool's paradise.</p>


<h4>SOCIAL DECLINE</h4>

<p>"Our descendants," a social worker remarked
to me, "will look back on the nineteenth century
as our Golden Age, just as we look back on
Greece." Thoughtful people whose work takes
them into the slime at the bottom of our foreignized
cities and industrial centers find decline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
actually upon us. A visiting nurse who has
worked for seven years in the stock-yards district
of Chicago reports that of late the drinking habit
is taking hold of foreign women at an alarming
rate. In the saloons there the dignified <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">stein</i> has
given way to the beer pail. In the Range towns
of Minnesota there are 356 saloons, of which
eighty-one are run by native-born, the rest chiefly
by recent immigrants. Into a Pennsylvania coal
town of 1,800 people, mostly foreign-born, are
shipped each week a car-load of beer and a barrel
of whisky. Where the new foreign-born are
numerous, women and children frequent the saloons
as freely as the men. In the cities family
desertion is growing at a great rate among foreign-born
husbands. Facts are justifying the
forecast made ten years ago by H. G. Wells: "If
things go on as they are going, the great mass of
them will remain a very low lower class&mdash;will remain
largely illiterate, industrialized peasants."</p>

<p>The continuance of depressive immigration will
lead to nothing catastrophic. Riots and labor
strife will oftener break out, but the country will
certainly not weaken nor collapse. Of patriotism,
of the military type there will be no lack. Scientific
and technical advance will go on the same.
The spread of business organization and efficiency
will continue. The only thing that will happen
will be a mysterious slackening in social progress.
The mass will give signs of sluggishness, and the
social procession will be strung out.</p>

<p>We are engaged in a generous rivalry with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
West Europeans and the Australians to see which
can do the most to lift the plane of life of the
masses. Presently we shall be dismayed by the
sense of falling behind. We shall be amazed to
find the Swiss or the Danes or the New Zealanders
making strides we cannot match. Stung with
mortification at losing our erstwhile lead in the
advancement of the common people, we shall cast
about for someone to blame. Ultimate causes, of
course, will be overlooked; only proximate causes
will be noticed. There will be loud outcry that
mothers, or teachers, or clergymen, or editors, or
social workers are not doing their duty. Our public
schools, solely responsible as they obviously
are for the intellectual and moral characteristics
of the people, will be roundly denounced; and it
will be argued that church schools must take their
place. There will be trying of this and trying of
that, together with much ingenious legislation.
As peasantism spreads and inertia proves unconquerable,
the opinion will grow that the old American
faith in the capacity and desire of the common
people for improvement was a delusion, and
that only the superior classes care for progress.
Not until the twenty-first century will the philosophic
historian be able to declare with scientific
certitude that the cause of the mysterious decline
that came upon the American people early in the
twentieth century was the deterioration of popular
intelligence by the admission of great numbers of
backward immigrants.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>IMMIGRANTS IN POLITICS</h3>


<p>On a single Chicago hoarding, before the
spring election of 1912, the writer saw the
political placards of candidates with the following
names: Kelly, Cassidy, Slattery, Alschuler,
Pfaelzer, Bartzen, Umbach, Andersen, Romano,
Knitckoff, Deneen, Hogue, Burres, Short. The
humor of calling "Anglo-Saxon" the kind of government
these gentlemen will give is obvious. At
that time, of the eighteen principal personages in
the city government of Chicago, fourteen had
Irish names, and three had German names. Of
the eleven principal officials in the city government
of Boston, nine had Irish names, and of the
forty-nine members of the Lower House from the
city of Boston, forty were obviously of Hibernian
extraction. In San Francisco, the mayor, all the
heads of the municipal departments, and ten out
of eighteen members on the board of supervisors,
bore names reminiscent of the Green Isle. As
far back as 1871, of 112 chiefs of police from
twenty-two States who attended the national police
convention, seventy-seven bore Irish names,
and eleven had German names. In 1881, of the
chiefs of police in forty-eight cities, thirty-three
were clearly Irish, and five were clearly German.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1908, on the occasion of a "home-coming"
celebration in Boston, a newspaper told how the
returning sons of Boston were "greeted by
Mayor Fitzgerald and the following members of
Congress: O'Connell, Kelihar, Sullivan, and
McNary&mdash;following in the footsteps of Webster,
Sumner, Adams, and Hoar. They were told of
the great work as Mayor of the late beloved Patrick
Collins. At the City Hall they found the
sons of Irish exiles and immigrants administering
the affairs of the metropolis of New England.
Besides the Mayor, they were greeted by John J.
Murphy, Chairman of the board of assessors;
Commissioner of Streets Doyle; Commissioner
of Baths O'Brien. Mr. Coakley is the head of the
Park Department, and Dr. Durgan directs the
Health Department. The Chief of the Fire Department
is John A. Mullen. Head of the Municipal
Printing Plant is Mr. Whelan. Superintendent
of the Street Cleaning is Cummings;
Superintendent of Sewers Leahy; Superintendent
of Buildings is Nolan; City Treasurer, Slattery;
Police Commissioner, O'Meara."</p>

<p>The Irish domination of our Northern cities is
the broadest mark immigration has left on American
politics; the immigrants from Ireland, for
the most part excessively poor, never got their
feet upon the land as did the Germans and the
Scandinavians, but remained huddled in cities.
United by strong race feelings, they held together
as voters, and, although never a clear majority,
were able in time to capture control of most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the greater municipalities. Now, for all their
fine Celtic traits, these Irish immigrants had
neither the temperament nor the training to make
a success of popular government. They were
totally without experience of the kind Americans
had acquired in the working of democratic institutions.
The ordinary American by this time
had become tinctured with the spirit of legalism.
Many voters were able to look beyond the persons
involved in a political contest and recognize the
principles at stake. Such popular maxims as:
"No man should be a judge in his own case,"
"The ballot a responsibility," "Patriotism above
party," "Measures, not men," "A public office is
a public trust," fostered self-restraint and helped
the voters to take an impersonal, long-range view
of political contests.</p>

<p>Warm-hearted, sociable, clannish, and untrained,
the naturalized Irish failed to respect the
first principles of civics. "What is the Constitution
between friends?" expresses their point of
view. In their eyes, an election is not the decision
of a great, impartial jury, but a struggle between
the "ins" and the "outs." Those who
vote the same way are "friends." To scratch
or to bolt is to "go back on your friends." Places
and contracts are "spoils." The official's first
duty is to find berths for his supporters. Not
fitness, but party work, is one's title to a place on
the municipal pay-roll. The city employee is to
serve his party rather than the public that pays
his salary. Even the justice of courts is to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
a matter of "pull" and "stand in," rather
than of inflexible rules.</p>

<p>A genial young Harvard man who has made the
Good Government movement a power in a certain
New England city said to me: "The Germans
want to know which candidate is better
qualified for the office. Among the Irish I have
never heard such a consideration mentioned.
They ask, 'Who wants this candidate?' 'Who is
behind him?' I have lined up a good many Irish
in support of Good Government men, but never
by setting forth the merits of a matter or a candidate.
I approach my Irish friends with the
personal appeal, 'Do this for me!' Nearly all
the Irish who support our cause do it on a personal
loyalty basis. The best of the Irish in this
city have often done as much harm to the cause
of Good Government as the worst. Mayor C., a
high-minded Irishman desiring to do the best he
could for the city, gave us as bad a government
as Mayor F., who thought of nothing but feathering
his own nest. Mayor C. 'stood by his
friends.'"</p>

<p>The Hibernian domination has given our cities
genial officials, brave policemen, and gallant fire-fighters.
It has also given them the name of being
the worst-governed cities in the civilized
world. The mismanagement and corruption of
the great cities of America have become a planetary
scandal, and have dealt the principle of manhood
suffrage the worst blow it has received in
the last half-century. Since the close of the Civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
War, hundreds of thousands of city-dwellers have
languished miserably or perished prematurely
from the bad water, bad housing, poor sanitation,
and rampant vice in American municipalities run
on the principles of the Celtic clan.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is likely that our British,
Teutonic, Scandinavian, and Jewish naturalized
citizens&mdash;still more our English-Canadian voters&mdash;have
benefited American politics. In politics
men are swayed by passion, prejudice, or reason.
By the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the
average American had come to be on his guard
against passion in politics, but not yet had he
reached the plane of reason. This left him the
prey of prejudice. Men inherited their politics,
and bragged of having always "voted straight."
They voted Democratic for Jefferson's sake, or
Republican from love of Lincoln. The citizens
followed ruts, while the selfish interests "followed
the ball." Now, the intelligent naturalized
foreigner, having inherited none of our prejudices,
would not respond to ancient cries or
war-time issues. He inquired pointedly what
each party proposed to do <em>now</em>. The abandonment
of "waving the bloody shirt" and the sudden
appearance of the politics of actuality in the
North, in the eighties, came about through the
naturalization of Karl and Ole. The South has
few foreign-born voters, and the South is precisely
that part of the country in which the reign
of prejudice in politics has longest delayed the
advent of efficient and progressive government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1910 there were certainly three million
naturalized citizens in the United States. In
southern New England and New York they constitute
a quarter of all the white voters. The
same is true of Illinois and the Old Northwest.
In Providence, Buffalo, Newark, St. Paul, and
Minneapolis, there are two foreign voters to three
native white voters. In Milwaukee, Detroit,
Cleveland, and Boston, the ratio is about one to
two. In Paterson, Chicago, and New York, the
ratio is nearer three to five, and in Fall River it
is three to four. When the foreigners are intelligent
and experienced in the use of the ballot,
their civic worth does not suffer by comparison
with that of the natives. Indianapolis and Kansas
City, in which the natives outnumber the naturalized
ten to one, do not overshadow in civic excellence
the Twin Cities of Minnesota, with three
natives to two naturalized. Cleveland, in which
the naturalized citizens constitute a third, is politically
superior to Cincinnati, in which they are
less than a sixth. Chicago, with thrice the proportion
of naturalized citizens Philadelphia has,
was roused and struggling with the python of corruption
while yet the city by the Delaware slept.</p>


<h4>THE NEW IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP</h4>

<p>Between 1895 and 1896 came the great shift in
the sources of immigration. In the former year,
55 per cent. of the aliens came from northwestern
Europe; in the next year, southern and southeastern
Europe gained the upper hand, and have kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
it ever since. With the change in nationalities
came a great change in the civic attitude of the
immigrants. The Immigration Commission
found that from 80 to 92 per cent. of the immigrants
from northwestern Europe, resident five
years or more in this country, have acquired citizenship
or have taken out first papers. Very
different are the following figures, which show the
interest in citizenship of the newer immigrants:</p>


<div class="center">

<tr><td align="left">Portuguese</td><td align="center">5.5</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>In 1890 and in 1900, 58 per cent. of the qualified
foreign-born men were voters; by 1910 the
proportion had fallen to 45.6 per cent. The presence
of multitudes of floating laborers who have
no intention of making this country their home,
a marked indifference to citizenship on the part
of some nationalities, and the stiffer requirements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
for naturalization imposed under the act of
1906, have caused the number of non-naturalized
qualified foreigners in this country to swell from
approximately 2,000,000 in 1900 to 3,500,000 in
1910. As things are going, we may expect a great
increase in the number of the unenfranchised.
No doubt the country is better off for their not
voting. Nevertheless, let it not be overlooked
that this growth in the proportion of voteless
wage-earners subtracts from the natural political
strength of labor. The appeal of labor in an industry
like the cotton manufacture of the North,
in which, besides the multitude of women and children,
70 per cent. of the foreign-born men remain
aliens after five years of residence, is likely to receive
scant consideration by the ordinary legislature.
Nor will such labor fare better at the
hands of local authorities. The anti-strike animus
of the police in Lawrence, Little Falls, and
Paterson was voiced by the official who gave to
the press the statement: "We have kept the foreign
element in subjection before, and will continue
to do so as long as I am chief of Little Falls'
police." Thus, without intending it, some of our
commonwealths are accumulating voteless workers,
like those conservative European states which
restrict manhood suffrage in the industrial
classes.</p>


<h4>THE NATURALIZED IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR LEADERS</h4>

<p>"Come over here quick, Luigi," writes an Italian
to his friend in Palermo. "This is a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a><br /><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a><br /><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
country. You can do anything you want to,
and, besides, they give you a vote you can get two
dollars for!" This Italian was an ignorant man,
but not necessarily a bad man. It would not be
just to look upon the later naturalized citizens as
caring less for the suffrage than the older immigrants.
Some of them appreciate the ballot all
the more from having been denied it in the old
country. For the Declaration of Independence
and the Fourth of July they show a naïve enthusiasm
which we Americans felt a generation ago,
before our muck had been raked. "The spirit
of revolt against wrong," says a well-known
worker among immigrants, "is stronger in the
foreign-born than in the natives, because they
come here expecting so much democracy, and
they are shocked by the reality they find. It is
they who insist upon the complete program of social
justice." Granting all this, there is no denying,
however, that many of the later immigrants
have only a dim understanding of what the ballot
means and how it may be used.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago we knew as little of the
ways of the ward boss as we knew of the megatherium
or the great auk. The sources of his
power were as mysterious as were the sources of
the Nile before Speke and Baker. Now, thanks
to Miss Addams and other settlement-workers
who have studied him in action from close at
hand, we have him on a film. The ward boss was
the discoverer of the fact that the ordinary immigrant
is a very poor, ignorant, and helpless man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
in the greatest need of assistance and protection.
Nevertheless, this man has, or soon will have, one
thing the politician greatly covets, namely, a vote.
The petty politician soon learned that by befriending
and aiding the foreigners at the right
time, he could build up an "influence" which he
might use or sell to his own enrichment. So the
ward politicians became pioneers in social work.
For the sake of controlling votes, they did many
things that the social settlement does for nothing.</p>

<p>It is Alderman Tim who gets the Italian a permit
for his push-cart or fruit-stand, who finds him
a city-hall job, or a place with a public-service
corporation, who protects him if he violates law
or ordinance in running his business, who goes
his bail if he is arrested, and "fixes things" with
the police judge or the state's attorney when he
comes to trial. Even before Giuseppe is naturalized,
it is Tim who remembers him at Christmas
with a big turkey, pays his rent at a pinch, or
wins his undying gratitude by saving his baby
from a pauper burial or sending carriages and
flowers to the funeral.</p>

<p>All this kindness and timely aid is prompted by
selfish motives. Amply is Tim repaid by Giuseppe's
vote on election day. But at first Giuseppe
misses the secret of the politician's interest in
him, and votes Tim-wise as one shows a favor to
a friend. Little does he dream of the dollar-harvest
from the public-service companies and
the vice interests Tim reaps with the "power"
he has built up out of the votes of the foreigners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
If, however, Giuseppe starts to be independent in
the election booth, he is startled by the Jekyll-Hyde
transformation of his erstwhile friend and
patron. He is menaced with loss of job, withdrawal
of permit or license. Suddenly the current
is turned on in the city ordinances affecting
him, and he is horrified to find himself in a mysterious
network of live wires. With the connivance
of a corrupt police force, Tim can even ruin
him on a trumped-up charge.</p>

<p>The law of Pennsylvania allows any voter who
demands it to receive "assistance" in the marking
of his ballot. So in Pittsburgh, Tim expects
Giuseppe to demand "assistance" and to take
Tim with him into the booth to mark his ballot
for him. Sometimes the election judges let Tim
thrust himself into the booth despite the foreigner's
protests, and watch how he marks his ballot.
In one precinct 92 per cent. of the voters received
"assistance." Two Italians who refused it lost
their jobs forthwith. The high-spirited North
Italians resent such intrusion, and some of them
threaten to cut to pieces the interloper. But always
the system is too strong for them.</p>

<p>Thus the way of Tim is to allure or to intimidate,
or even combine the two. The immigrant
erecting a little store is visited by a building inspector
and warned that his interior arrangements
are all wrong. His friends urge the distracted
man to "see Tim." He does so, and kind
Tim "fixes it up," gaining thereby another loyal
henchman. The victim never learns that the inspector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
was sent to teach him the need of a protector.
So long as the immigrant is "right," he
may put an encroaching bay-window on his house
or store, keep open his saloon after midnight, or
pack into his lodging-house more than the legal
number of lodgers. Moved ostensibly by a deep
concern for public health or safety or morals, the
city council enacts a great variety of health, building,
and trades ordinances, in order that Tim may
have plenty of clubs to hold over the foreigner's
head.</p>

<p>So between boss and immigrant grows up a
relation like that between a feudal lord and his
vassals. In return for the boss's help and protection,
the immigrant gives regularly his vote.
The small fry get drinks or jobs, or help in time
of trouble. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrone</i>, liquor-dealer, or lodging-house
keeper gets license or permit or immunity
from prosecution, provided he "delivers"
the votes of enough of his fellow-countrymen.
The ward boss realizes perfectly what his political
power rests on, and is very conscientious in
looking after his supporters. Of the Irish "gray
wolves" in the Chicago council I was told, "Each
of them is a natural ward leader, and will go
through hell-fire for his people and they for him."</p>

<p>To the boss with a hold on the immigrant the
requirement that the poor fellow shall live five
years in this country before voting presents itself
as an empty legal formality. In 1905 a special
examiner of the Federal Department of Justice
reported: "Naturalization frauds have grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
and spread with the growth and spread of the
alien population of the United States, until there
is scarcely a city or county-seat town ... where
in some form these frauds have not from time to
time been committed." In 1845 a Louisiana
judge was impeached and removed for fraud, the
principal evidence being that he had issued certificates
to 400 aliens in one day. The legislature
might have been more lenient could it have foreseen
that in 1868 a single judge in New York
would issue 2500 of such certificates in one day!
The gigantic naturalization frauds committed in
the Presidential campaign of 1868 resulted in an
investigation by Congress and in the placing of
congressional elections under Federal supervision.
During the month of October two New
York judges issued 54,000 certificates. An investigation
in 1902 showed about 25,000 fraudulent
certificates of naturalization in use in that
city.</p>

<p>There is hardly need nowadays to recount what
Tim and his kind have done with the power they
filched through the votes of Giuseppe and Jan and
Michael. They have sold out the city to the franchise-seeking
corporations. They have jobbed
public works and pocketed a "rake-off" on all
municipal supplies. They have multiplied jobs
and filled them with lazy henchmen. By making
merchandise of building laws or health ordinances,
they have caused an unknown number of
people to be crushed, or burned, or poisoned.
Worst of all, by selling immunity from police interference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
to the vice interests, they have let the
race be preyed on and consumed in the bud.
Thanks to their "protection," a shocking proportion
of the inhabitants of our cities of mixed population
are destroyed by drinking, dissipation, and
venereal diseases.</p>

<p>It is in the cities with many naturalized foreigners
or enfranchised negroes that the vice interests
have had the freest hand in exploiting and
degrading the people. These foreigners have no
love for vice, but unwittingly they become the
corner-stone of the system that supports it. The
city that has had the most and the rawest foreign-born
voters is the city of the longest and
closest partnership of the police with vice. Tammany
Hall first gained power by its "voting
gangs" of foreigners, and ever since its Old
Guard has been the ignorant, naturalized immigrants.
Exposed again and again, and thought
to be shattered, Tammany has survived all shocks,
<em>because its supply of raw material has never been
cut off</em>. Not the loss of its friends has ever defeated
it; only the union of its foes. The only
things it fears are those that bore from within&mdash;social
settlements, social centers, the quick intelligence
of the immigrant Hebrew, stricter naturalization,
and restriction of immigration.</p>

<p>In every American city with a large pliant foreign
vote have appeared the boss, the machine,
and the Tammany way. Once the machine gets
a grip on the situation, it broadens and entrenches
its power by intimidation at the polls, ballot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
frauds, vote purchase, saloon influence, and the
support of the vicious and criminal. But its tap-root
is the simple-minded foreigner or negro, and
without them no lasting vicious political control
has shown itself in any of our cities.</p>

<p>The machine in power uses the foreigner to
keep in power. The Italian who opens an ice-cream
parlor has to have a victualer's license, and
he can keep this license only by delivering Italian
votes. The Polish saloon-keeper loses his liquor
license if he fails to line up his fellow-countrymen
for the local machine. The politician who
can get dispensations for the foreigners who want
their beer on a Sunday picnic is the man who attracts
the foreign vote. Thus, until they get their
eyes open and see how they are being used, the
foreigners constitute an asset of the established
political machine, neutralizing the anti-machine
ballots of an equal number of indignant intelligent
American voters.</p>

<p>The saloon is often an independent swayer of
the foreign vote. The saloon-keeper is interested
in fighting all legal regulation of his own business,
and of other businesses&mdash;gambling, dance-halls,
and prostitution&mdash;which stimulate drinking. If
"blue" laws are on the statute-book, these interests
may combine to seat in the mayor's chair
a man pledged not to enforce them. Even if the
saloon-keeper has no political ax of his own to
grind, his masters, the brewers, will insist that he
get out the vote for the benefit of themselves or
their friends. Since liberal plying with beer is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
a standard means of getting out the foreign vote,
the immigrant saloon-keeper is obliged to become
the debaucher and betrayer of his fellow-countrymen.
In Chicago the worthy Germans and Bohemians
are marshaled in the "United Societies,"
ostensibly social organizations along nationality
lines, but really the machinery through which the
brewers and liquor-dealers may sway the foreign-born
vote not only in defense of liquor, but also
in defense of other corrupt and affiliated interests.</p>

<p>The foreign press is another means of misleading
the naturalized voters. These newspapers&mdash;Polish,
Bohemian, Italian, Greek, Yiddish, etc.,&mdash;while
they have no small influence with their
readers, are poorly supported, and often in financial
straits. Many of them, therefore, can be
tempted to sell their political influence to the highest
bidder, which is, of course, the party representing
the special interests. Thus the innocent
foreign-born readers are led like sheep to the
shambles, and Privilege gains another intrenching-tool.</p>


<h4>THE LOSS OF POLITICAL LIKE-MINDEDNESS</h4>

<p>If the immigrant is neither debauched nor misled,
but votes his opinions, is he then an element
of strength to us?</p>

<p>When a people has reached such a degree of
political like-mindedness, that fundamentals are
taken for granted, it is free to tackle new questions
as they come up. But if it admits to citizenship
myriads of strangers who have not yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a><br /><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a><br /><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
passed the civic kindergarten, questions that were
supposed to be settled are reopened. The citizens
are made to thresh over again old straw&mdash;the
relation of church to state, of church to school,
of state to parent, of law to the liquor trade.
Meanwhile, ripe sheaves ready to yield the wheat
of wisdom under the flails of discussion lie untouched.
Pressing questions&mdash;public hygiene,
conservation, the control of monopoly, the protection
of labor, go to the foot of the docket, and public
interests suffer.</p>

<p>Some are quite cheerful about the confusion,
cross-purposes, and delay that come with heterogeneity,
because they think the variety of views
introduced by immigration is a fine thing, "keeps
us from getting into a rut." The plain truth is,
that rarely does an immigrant bring in his intellectual
baggage anything of use to us. The music
of Mascagni and Debussy, the plays of Ibsen and
Maeterlinck, the poetry of Rostand and Hauptmann,
the fiction of Jókai and Sienkiewicz were
not brought to us by way of Ellis Island. What
we want is not ideas merely, but fruitful ideas,
fructifying ideas. By debating the ideas of
Nietzsche, Ostwald, Bergson, Metchnikoff, or
Ellen Key, American thought is stimulated. But
should we gain from the introduction of old Asiatic
points of view, which would reopen such questions
as witchcraft, child-marriage, and suttee?
The clashings that arise from the presence among
us of many voters with medieval minds are sheer
waste of energy. While we Americans wrangle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
over the old issues of clericalism, separate schools,
and "personal liberty," the little homogeneous
peoples&mdash;Norwegians and Danes and New Zealanders&mdash;are
forging ahead of us in rational politics
and learning to look pityingly upon us as a
chaos rather than a people.</p>


<h4>POLITICAL MYSTICISM VS. COMMON SENSE</h4>

<p>If you should ask an Englishman whether the
tone of political life in his country would remain
unaffected by the admission to the electorate
of a couple of million Cypriotes, Vlachs, and Bessarabians
after five years' residence, he would take
you for a madman. Suggest to the German that
the plane of political intelligence in reading and
thinking Germany would not be lowered by the
access to the ballot-box of multitudes of Serbs,
Georgians, and Druses of Lebanon, and he will
consign you to bedlam. Assure the son of Norway
that the vote of the Persian or Yemenite, of
sixty months' residence in Norway, will be as
often wise and right as his own, and he will be insulted.
It is only we Americans who assume that
the voting of the Middle Atlantic States, with
their million of naturalized citizens, or of the East
North Central States, with <em>their</em> million, is as
sane, discriminating, and forward-looking as it
would be without them.</p>

<p>The Italian historian and sociologist Ferrero,
after reviewing our immigration policy, concludes
that the Americans, far from being "practical,"
are really the mystics of the modern world. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
says: "To confer citizenship each year upon
great numbers of men born and educated in foreign
countries&mdash;men who come with ideas and
sympathies totally out of spirit with the diverse
conditions in the new country; to grant them
political rights they do not want, and of which
they have never thought; to compel them to declare
allegiance to a political constitution which
they often do not understand; to try to transform
subjects of old European monarchies into free
citizens of young American republics over night&mdash;is
not all this to do violence to common sense?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>AMERICAN BLOOD AND IMMIGRANT BLOOD</h3>


<p>As I sought to show, near the end of my initial
chapter, the conditions of settlement of this
country caused those of uncommon energy and venturesomeness
to outmultiply the rest of the population.
Thus came into existence the pioneering
breed; and this breed increased until it is safe
to estimate that fully half of white Americans with
native grandparents have one or more pioneers
among their ancestors. Whatever valuable race
traits distinguish the American people from the
parent European stocks are due to the efflorescence
of this breed. Without it there would have
been little in the performance of our people to
arrest the attention of the world. Now we confront
the melancholy spectacle of this pioneer
breed being swamped and submerged by an overwhelming
tide of latecomers from the old-world
hive. In Atlanta still seven out of eight
white men had American parents; in Nashville
and Richmond, four out of five; in Kansas
City, two out of three; and in Los Angeles,
one out of two; but in Detroit, Cleveland,
and Paterson one man out of five had American
parents; in Chicago and New York, one out of
six; in Milwaukee, one out of seven; and in Fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a><br /><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a><br /><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
River, one out of nine. <em>Certainly never since the
colonial era have the foreign-born and their children
formed so large a proportion of the American
people as at the present moment.</em> I scanned
368 persons as they passed me in Union Square,
New York, at a time when the garment-workers
of the Fifth Avenue lofts were returning to their
homes. Only thirty-eight of these passers-by had
the type of face one would find at a county fair
in the West or South.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="stock" id="stock"></a>
<img src="images/i283.jpg" width="600" height="384" alt="stock" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Distribution of Foreign Stock in the United States&mdash;1910</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the six or seven hundred thousand strangers
that yearly join themselves to us for good and
all, there are to be found, of course, every talent
and every beauty. Out of the steerage come persons
as fine and noble as any who have trodden
American soil. Any adverse characterization of
an immigrant stream implies, then, only that the
trait is relatively frequent, not that it is universal.</p>

<p>In this sense it is fair to say that the blood
now being injected into the veins of our people
is "sub-common." To one accustomed to the aspect
of the normal American population, the Caliban
type shows up with a frequency that is startling.
Observe immigrants not as they come
travel-wan up the gang-plank, nor as they issue
toil-begrimed from pit's mouth or mill gate, but
in their gatherings, washed, combed, and in their
Sunday best. You are struck by the fact that
from ten to twenty per cent. are hirsute, low-browed,
big-faced persons of obviously low mentality.
Not that they suggest evil. They simply
look out of place in black clothes and stiff collar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
since clearly they belong in skins, in wattled huts
at the close of the Great Ice Age. These oxlike
men are descendants of those <em>who always stayed
behind</em>. Those in whom the soul burns with the
dull, smoky flame of the pine-knot stuck to the
soil, and are now thick in the sluiceways of immigration.
Those in whom it burns with a clear,
luminous flame have been attracted to the cities
of the home land and, having prospects, have no
motive to submit themselves to the hardships of
the steerage.</p>

<p>To the practised eye, the physiognomy of certain
groups unmistakably proclaims inferiority
of type. I have seen gatherings of the foreign-born
in which narrow and sloping foreheads were
the rule. The shortness and smallness of the
crania were very noticeable. There was much
facial asymmetry. Among the women, beauty,
aside from the fleeting, epidermal bloom of girlhood,
was quite lacking. In every face there was
something wrong&mdash;lips thick, mouth coarse, upper
lip too long, cheek-bones too high, chin poorly
formed, the bridge of the nose hollowed, the base
of the nose tilted, or else the whole face prognathous.
There were so many sugar-loaf heads,
moon-faces, slit mouths, lantern-jaws, and goose-bill
noses that one might imagine a malicious jinn
had amused himself by casting human beings in
a set of skew-molds discarded by the Creator.</p>

<p>Our captains of industry give a crowbar to the
immigrant with a number nine face on a number
six head, make a dividend out of him, and imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
that is the end of the matter. They overlook that
this man will beget children in his image&mdash;two or
three times as many as the American&mdash;and that
these children will in turn beget children. They
chuckle at having opened an inexhaustible store
of cheap tools and, lo! the American people is
being altered for all time by these tools. Once
before, captains of industry took a hand in making
this people. Colonial planters imported Africans
to hoe in the sun, to "develop" the tobacco, indigo,
and rice plantations. Then, as now, business-minded
men met with contempt the protests of a
few idealists against their way of "building up
the country."</p>

<p>Those promoters of prosperity are dust, but
they bequeathed a situation which in four years
wiped out more wealth than two hundred years
of slavery had built up, and which presents to-day
the one unsolvable problem in this country.
Without likening immigrants to negroes, one may
point out how the latter-day employer resembles
the old-time planter in his blindness to the effects
of his labor policy upon the blood of the nation.</p>


<h4>IMMIGRATION AND GOOD LOOKS</h4>

<p>It is reasonable to expect an early falling off
in the frequency of good looks in the American
people. It is unthinkable that so many persons
with crooked faces, coarse mouths, bad noses,
heavy jaws, and low foreheads can mingle their
heredity with ours without making personal
beauty yet more rare among us than it actually is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
So much ugliness is at last bound to work to the
surface. One ought to see the horror on the face
of a fine-looking Italian or Hungarian consul when
one asks him innocently, "Is the physiognomy of
these immigrants typical of your people?" That
the new immigrants are inferior in looks to the
old immigrants may be seen by comparing, in a
Labor Day parade, the faces of the cigar-makers
and the garment-workers with those of the teamsters,
piano-movers and steam-fitters.</p>

<p>Even aside from the pouring in of the ill-favored,
the crossing of the heterogeneous is
bound to lessen good looks among us. It is noteworthy
that the beauty which has often excited the
admiration of European visitors has shown itself
most in communities of comparative purity of
blood. New England, Virginia, and Kentucky
have been renowned for their beautiful women,
but not the commonwealths with a mixed population.
It is in the less-heterogeneous parts of the
Middle West, such as Indiana and Kansas, that
one is struck by the number of comely women.</p>

<p>Twenty-four years ago the greatest living
philosopher advised inquiring Japanese statesmen
to interdict marriages of Japanese with foreigners,
on the ground that the crossings of the
too-unlike produce human beings with a "chaotic
constitution." Herbert Spencer went on to say,
"When the varieties mingled diverge beyond a
certain slight degree, the result is inevitably a
bad one." The greatest students of hybridism
to-day confirm Spencer's surmise. The fusing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
American with German and Scandinavian immigrants
was only a reblending of kindred stocks,
for Angles, Jutes, Danes, and Normans were
wrought of yore into the fiber of the English
breed. But the human varieties being collected
in this country by the naked action of economic
forces are too dissimilar to blend without producing
a good many faces of a "chaotic constitution."
Just as there is a wide difference in looks between
Bretons and Normans, Dutch and Hanoverians,
the Chinese of Hu-peh and the Chinese of
Fukien, so broad contrasts in good looks may in
time appear between the pure-blood parts of our
country and those which have absorbed a motley
assortment of immigrants.</p>


<h4>STATURE AND PHYSIQUE</h4>

<p>Although the Slavs stand up well, our South
Europeans run to low stature. A gang of Italian
navvies filing along the street present, by their
dwarfishness, a curious contrast to other people.
The Portuguese, the Greeks, and the Syrians are,
from our point of view, undersized. The Hebrew
immigrants are very poor in physique. The
average of Hebrew women in New York is just
over five feet, and the young women in the garment
factories, although well developed, appear
to be no taller than native girls of thirteen.</p>

<p>On the physical side the Hebrews are the polar
opposite of our pioneer breed. Not only are they
undersized and weak-muscled, but they shun bodily
activity and are exceedingly sensitive to pain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Says a settlement worker: "You can't make boy
scouts out of the Jews. There's not a troop of
them in all New York." Another remarks:
"They are absolute babies about pain. Their
young fellows will scream with a hard lick."
Students observe that husky young Hebrews on
the foot-ball team lack grit, and will "take on"
if they are bumped into hard. A young Ontario
miner noticed that his Hebrew comrades groaned
and wept over the hardships of the trail. "They
kept swapping packs with me, imagining my pack
must be lighter because I wasn't hollering."</p>

<p>Natural selection, frontier life, and the example
of the red man produced in America a type of
great physical self-control, gritty, uncomplaining,
merciless to the body through fear of becoming
"soft." To this roaming, hunting, exploring,
adventurous breed what greater contrast is there
than the denizens of the Ghetto? The second
generation, to be sure, overtop their parents and
are going in for athletics. Hebrews under Irish
names abound in the prize-ring, and not long ago
a sporting editor printed the item, "Jack Sullivan
received a letter in Yiddish yesterday from
his sister." Still, it will be long before they produce
the stoical type who blithely fares forth into
the wilderness, portaging his canoe, poling it
against the current, wading in the torrents, living
on bacon and beans, and sleeping on the ground,
all for "fun" or "to keep hard."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>


<h4>VITALITY</h4>

<p>"The Slavs," remarks a physician, "are immune
to certain kinds of dirt. They can stand what
would kill a white man." The women do not have
puerperal fever, as our women would under their
conditions. The men violate every sanitary law,
yet survive. The Slavs come from a part of the
world in which never more than a third of the
children have grown up. In every generation,
dirt, ignorance, superstition, and lack of medical
attention have winnowed out all but the sturdiest.
Among Americans, two-thirds of the children
grow up, which means that we keep alive many of
the tenderer, who would certainly have perished
in the Slavic world. There is, however, no illusion
more grotesque than to suppose that our people
is to be rejuvenated by absorbing these millions
of hardy peasantry, that, to quote a champion
of free immigration, "The new-comers in
America will bring fresh, vigorous blood to a
rather sterile and inbred stock." The fact is that
the immigrant stock quickly loses here its distinctive
ruggedness. The physicians practising
among rural Poles notice a great saving of infant
life under American conditions. Says one: "I
see immigrant women and their grown daughters
having infants at the same time, and the children
of the former will die of the things that the children
of the latter get well of. The same holds
when the second generation and the third bear
at the same time. The latter save their children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
better than the former." The result is a marked
softening of fiber between the immigrant women
and the granddaughters. Among the latter are
many of a finer, but frailer, mold, who would be
ruined in health if they worked in the field the
third day after confinement, as grandmother did.
In the old country there were very few of this
type who survived infancy in a peasant family.</p>

<p>There is, then, no lasting revitalization from
this tide of life. If our people has become weak,
no transfusion of peasants will set it on its feet
again; for their blood too, soon thins. The
trouble, if you call it that, is not with the American
people, but with the wide diffusion among us
of a civilized manner of life. Where the struggle
for existence is mitigated not merely for the upper
quarter of society, as formerly in the Old World,
but for the upper three-quarters, as in this and
other democratic countries, the effects of keeping
alive the less hardy are bound to show. The remedy
for the alleged degeneration of our stock is
simple, but drastic. If we want only constitutions
that can stand hardship and abuse, let us treat
the young as they are treated in certain poverty-stricken
parts of Russia. Since the mother is
obliged to pass the day at work in distant
fields, the nursling of a few months is left alone,
crawling about on the dirt floor of the hut and
comforting itself, when it cries from hunger,

hands and feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>


<h4>MORALITY</h4>

<p>That the Mediterranean peoples are morally
below the races of northern Europe is as certain
as any social fact. Even when they were dirty,
ferocious barbarians, these blonds were truth-tellers.
Be it pride or awkwardness or lack of
imagination or fair-play sense, something has held
them back from the nimble lying of the southern
races. Immigration officials find that the different
peoples are as day and night in point of
veracity, and report vast trouble in extracting
the truth from certain brunet nationalities.</p>

<p>Some champions of immigration have become
broad-minded enough to think small of the cardinal
virtues. The Syrians, on Boston testimony,
took "great pains to cheat the charitable societies"
and are "extremely untrustworthy and unreliable."
Their defender, however, after admitting
their untruthfulness, explains that their
lying is altruistic. If, at the fork of a road, you
ask a Syrian your way, he will, in sheer transport
of sympathy, study you to discover what answer
will most please you. "The Anglo-Saxon variety
of truthfulness," she adds, "is not a Syrian
characteristic"; but, "if truthfulness includes
loyalty, ready self-denial to promote a cause that
seems right, the Syrian is to that extent truthful."
Quoting a Syrian's admission that his fellow-merchants
pay their debts for their credit's
sake, but will cheat the customer, she comments,
"This, however, does not seem to be exclusively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
a Syrian vice." To such miserable paltering
does a sickly sentimentality lead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In southern Europe, team-work along all lines
is limited by selfishness and bad faith. Professor
Fairchild notes "the inveterate factionalism
and commercial dishonesty so characteristic of
the [Greek] race," "the old dishonesty and inability
to work together." "One of the maxims
of Greek business life, translated into the American
vernacular, is 'Put out the other fellow's
eye.'" "These people seemed incapable of
carying on a large coöperative business with harmony
and success."</p>

<p>Nothing less than verminous is the readiness of
the southern Europeans to prey upon their fellows.
Never were British or Scandinavian immigrants
so bled by fellow-countrymen as are
South Italian, Greek and Semitic immigrants.
Their spirit of mutual helpfulness saved them
from <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrone</i>, "banker," and Black Hand.
Among our South Italians this spirit shines
out only when it is a question of shielding from
American justice some cut-throat of their own
race. The Greek is full of tricks to skin the
greenhorn. A grocer will warn fellow-countrymen
who have just established themselves in his
town that he will have the police on them for violating
municipal ordinances unless they buy groceries
from him. The Greek mill-hand sells the
greenhorn a job, and takes his chances on the
foreman giving the man work. A Greek who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
knows a little English will get a Greek peddler
arrested in order that he may get the interpreter's
fee. The Greek boot-black who has freed
himself from his serfdom, instead of showing up
the system, starts a place of his own, and exploits
his help as mercilessly as ever he was exploited.</p>

<p>The Northerners seem to surpass the southern
Europeans in innate ethical endowment. Comparison
of their behavior in marine disasters
shows that discipline, sense of duty, presence of
mind, and consideration for the weak are much
more characteristic of northern Europeans. The
southern Europeans, on the other hand, are apt,
in their terror, to forget discipline, duty, women,
children, everything but the saving of their own
lives. In shipwreck it is the exceptional Northerner
who forgets his duty, and the exceptional
Southerner who is bound by it. The suicide of
Italian officers on board the doomed <i>Monte Tabor</i>,
the <i>Notice</i>, and the <i>Ajace</i>, is in striking contrast
to the sense of responsibility of the Northerners
in charge of the <i>Cimbria</i>, the <i>Geiser</i>, the
<i>Strathcona</i>, and the <i>City of Paris</i>. Compare the
mad struggle for the boats among the southern
Europeans on <i>La Bourgogne</i>, the <i>Ailsa</i>, and the
<i>Utopia</i>, with the self-possession of the Scandinavian
emigrants on the <i>Waesland</i> and the <i>Danmark</i>,
and the consideration for women and children
shown on the sinking <i>Mohegan</i>, the <i>Waesland</i>, and
the <i>Titanic</i>. Among all nationalities the Americans
bear the palm for coolness, orderly saving of
life, and consideration for the weak in shipwreck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
but they will lose these traits in proportion as
they absorb excitable mercurial blood from southern
Europe.</p>


<h4>NATURAL ABILITY</h4>

<p>The performance of the foreign-born and their
children after they have had access to American
opportunities justifies the democrat's faith that
latent capacity exists all through the humbler
strata of society. On the other hand, it also confirms
the aristocrat's insistence that social ranks
correspond somewhat with the grades of natural
ability existing within a people. The descendants
of Europe's lowly are to be met in all the
upper levels of American society, <em>but not so frequently</em>
as the descendents of those who were high
or rising in the land they left.</p>

<p>In respect to the value it contains, a stream of
immigrants may be <em>representative</em>, <em>super-representative</em>,
or <em>sub-representative</em> of the home people.
When it is a fair sample, it is <em>representative</em>;
when it is richer in wheat and poorer in
chaff, it is <em>super-representative</em>; when the reverse
is the case, it is <em>sub-representative</em>. What counts
here, of course, is not the value the immigrants
may have acquired by education or experience,
but that fundamental worth which does not depend
on opportunity, and which may be transmitted
to one's descendants. Now, in the present
state of our knowledge, it is perhaps risky to make
a comparison in ability between the races which
contributed the old immigration and those which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
are supplying the new immigration. Though
backward, the latter may contain as good stuff.
But it is fair to assume that a <em>super-representative</em>
immigration from one stock is worth more
to us than a <em>sub-representative</em> immigration from
another stock, and that an influx which sub-represents
a European people will thin the blood of
the American people.</p>

<p>Many things have decided whether Europe
should send America cream or skimmed milk.
Religious or political oppression is apt to drive
out the better elements. Racial oppression cannot
be evaded by mere conformity; hence the emigration
it sets up is apt to be representative. An
unsubdued and perilous land attracts the more
bold and enterprising. The seekers of homesteads
include men of better stuff than the job-seekers
attracted by high wages for unskilled
labor. Only economic motives set in motion the
sub-common people, but even in an economic emigration
the early stage brings more people of
initiative than the later. The deeper, straighter,
and smoother the channels of migration, the lower
the stratum they can tap.</p>

<p>It is not easy to value the early elements that
were wrought into the American people. Often
a stream of immigration that started with the
best drained from the lower levels after it had
worn itself a bed. It is therefore only in a broad
way that I venture to classify the principal colonial
migrations as follows:</p>

<p><i>Super-representative</i>: English Pilgrims, Puritans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Quakers, Catholics, Scotch Covenanters,
French Huguenots, German sectaries.</p>

<p><i>Representative</i>: English of Virginia, Maryland,
and the Carolinas, Scotch-Irish, Scotch
Highlanders, Dutch, and Swedes.</p>

<p><i>Sub-representative</i>: English of early Georgia,
transported English, eighteenth-century Germans.</p>

<p>In our national period the Germans of 1848
stand out as a <i>super-representative</i> flow. The
Irish stream has been <i>representative</i>, as was also
the early German migration. The German inflow
since 1870 has brought us very few of the élite
of their people, and I have already given reasons
for believing that the Scandinavian stream is not
altogether <i>representative</i>. Our immigration from
Great Britain has distinctly fallen off in grade
since the chances in America came to be less attractive
than those in the British Empire. However,
no less an authority than Sir Richard Cartwright
thinks that "between 1866 and 1896 one-third
at least of the whole male population of
Canada between the ages of twenty and forty
found their way to the United States," and this
"included an immense percentage of the most
intelligent and adventurous." To-day we reciprocate
by sending Western farmers with capital
into the Canadian Northwest. Our loss has
amounted to as many as 100,000 in a single year.</p>

<p>Oppression is now out of fashion over most of
Europe, and our public lands are gone. Economic
motives more and more bring us immigrants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and such motives will not uproot the educated,
the propertied, the established, the well connected.
The children of success are not migrating,
which means that we get few scions from
families of proved capacity. Europe retains
most of her brains, but sends multitudes of the
common and the sub-common. There is little sign
of an intellectual element among the Magyars,
Russians, South Slavs, Italians, Greeks, or
Portuguese. This does not hold, however, for
currents created by race discrimination or oppression.
The Armenian, Syrian, Finnish, and Russo-Hebrew
streams seem <i>representative</i>, and the
first wave of Hebrews out of Russia in the eighties
was superior. The Slovaks, German Poles, Lithuanians,
Esthonians, and other restive subject
groups probably send us a fair sample of their
quality.</p>


<h4>RACE SUICIDE</h4>

<p>The fewer brains they have to contribute, the
lower the place immigrants take among us, and
the lower the place they take, the faster they multiply.
In 1890, in our cities, a thousand foreign-born
women could show 565 children under five
years of age to 309 children shown by a thousand
native women. By 1900 the contribution of the
foreign women had risen to 612, and that of the
American women had declined to 296. From such
figures some argue that the "sterile" Americans
need the immigrants in order to supply population.
It would be nearer the truth to argue that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the competition of low-standard immigrants is
the root cause of the mysterious "sterility" of
Americans. Certainly their record down to 1830
proved the Americans to be as fertile a race as
ever lived, and the decline in their fertility coincides
in time and in locality with the advent of
the immigrant flood. In the words of General
Francis A. Walker, "Not only did the decline in
the native element, as a whole, take place in singular
correspondence with the excess of foreign
arrivals, but it occurred chiefly in just those regions"&mdash;"in
those States and in the very counties,"
he says elsewhere&mdash;"to which those newcomers
most frequently resorted."</p>

<p>"Our immigrants," says a superintendent of
charities, "often come here with no standards
whatever. In their homes you find no sheets on
the bed, no slips on the pillows, no cloth on the
table, and no towels save old rags. Even in the
mud-floor cabins of the poorest negroes of the
South you find sheets, pillow-slips, and towels,
for by serving and associating with the whites
the blacks have gained standards. But many of
the foreigners have no means of getting our home
standards after they are here. No one shows
them. They can't see into American homes, and
no Americans associate with them." The Americans
or Americanized immigrants who are
obliged to live on wages fixed by the competition
of such people must cut somewhere. If they do
not choose to "live in a pig-pen and bring up one's
children like pigs," they will save their standards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a><br /><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a><br /><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
by keeping down the size of the family. Because
he keeps them clean, neatly dressed, and in school,
children are an economic burden to the American.
Because he lets them run wild and puts them to
work early, children are an asset to the low-standard
foreigner.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="native" id="native"></a>
<img src="images/i301.jpg" width="600" height="381" alt="native" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Distribution of Native White Stock in the United States&mdash;1910</p></div>
</div>

<p>When a more-developed element is obliged to
compete on the same economic plane with a less-developed
element, the standards of cleanliness
or decency or education cherished by the advanced
element act on it like a slow poison. William does
not leave as many children as 'Tonio, because he
will not huddle his family into one room, eat macaroni
off a bare board, work his wife barefoot in
the field, and keep his children weeding onions instead
of at school. Even moral standards may
act as poison. Once the women raisin-packers at
Fresno, California, were American-born. Now
the American women are leaving because of the
low moral tone that prevails in the working force
by reason of the coming in of foreigners with
lax notions of propriety. The coarseness of
speech and behavior among the packers is giving
raisin-packing a bad name, so that American
women are quitting the work and taking the next
best job. Thus the very decency of the native is
a handicap to success and to fecundity.</p>

<p>As they feel the difficulty of keeping up their
standards on a Slav wage, the older immigrant
stocks are becoming sterile, even as the old Americans
became sterile. In a generation complaint
will be heard that the Slavs, too, are shirking big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
families, and that we must admit prolific Persians,
Uzbegs, and Bokhariots, in order to offset
the fatal sterility that attacks every race after
it has become Americanized. Very truly says a
distinguished economist, in praise of immigration:
"The cost of rearing children in the United States
is rapidly rising. In many, perhaps in most
cases, it is simpler, speedier, and cheaper to import
labor than to breed it." In like vein it is
said that "a healthy immigrant lad of eighteen is
a clear $1000 added to the national wealth of the
United States."</p>

<p>Just so. "The Roman world was laughing
when it died." Any couple or any people that
does not feel it has anything to transmit to its
children may well reason in such fashion. A
couple may reflect, "It is simpler, speedier, and
cheaper for us to adopt orphans than to produce
children of our own." A nation may reason,
"Why burden ourselves with the rearing of children?
Let them perish unborn in the womb of
time. The immigrants will keep up the population."
A people that has no more respect for
its ancestors and no more pride of race than this
deserves the extinction that surely awaits it.</p>
